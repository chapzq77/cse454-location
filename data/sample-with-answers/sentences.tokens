39501	There were `` quality problems '' with some school buildings damaged during the catastrophic earthquakes in southwest China 's Sichuan Province on May 12 , an official said here on Thursday .
39502	The problems could have happened because some school rooms were built too fast without regard to quality in recent years , Ma Zongjin , director of the the National Wenchuan Earthquake Expert Committee , said at a press briefing on the evaluation of the earthquake aftermath .
39503	It is feared the death toll in the 8.0-magnitude earthquake centered in Wenchuan County , Sichuan , will top 87,000 .
39504	Many victims were students killed in collapsed buildings .
39505	This has aroused wide suspicion and anger over shoddy construction and substandard materials allegedly used to build schools .
39506	The Chinese government has also promised to investigate the issue .
39507	Various factors might work jointly to damage thousands of school buildings in the earthquake area , such as the intensity of the quake , and poor design , Ma said .
39508	For example , if the roof of a classroom is too wide , it will be too weak to withstand strong quakes , he said .
39509	Prof. Shi Peijun with the committee said among 845.1 billion yuan -LRB- about 121 billion U.S. dollars -RRB- in direct economic losses for the May 12 earthquake , 20.4 percent came from damaged essential public buildings such as schools and hospitals .
39510	Ma said the Ministry of Construction sent more than 2,000 experts to areas affected by the earthquake to investigate .
39511	`` The earthquake was so powerful and destructive in some areas that not only school buildings , but office and residential buildings were all damaged , '' he said .
39512	But poor design by architects and the use of substandard building materials might also have played a role in the massive destruction , he said .
39513	`` It is possible there were problems with those buildings , because there has been a rush of construction of schools recently , '' he said .
39514	Ma said the investigation would provide guidelines for reconstruction of schools and hospitals in future .

1502558	Malaysian former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad announced his resignation from Malaysia ' s main ruling party UMNO with immediate effect in Alor Star , capital of northern Kedah state on Monday .
1502559	Mahathir said he made the decision to leave UMNO as he had lost confidence in the party 's present leadership for failing to protect the interests and well - being of the Malays ,
1502560	`` I am quitting UMNO today , '' he announced this before 1,000 people , mainly Kedah UMNO members .
1502561	The former UMNO president said he would only return as an UMNO member after Prime Minister and UMNO president Abdullah Ahmad Badawi resigned from the posts or was no longer the country 's top leader .
1502562	`` I will write a letter to UMNO headquarters to inform that I had quit the party , '' said Mahathir who was prime minister and UMNO president for 22 years .
1502563	Speaking to reporters after the function entitled `` Fate of the Malay Race '' organized by the Kedah Malay Assembly Hall , a visibly disappointed Mahathir said he decided to leave UMNO because he felt the party could no longer serve as a genuine political party to protect Malay rights and interests , UMNO 's founding objectives .
1502564	Expressing his dissatisfaction , Mahathir , who has been a UMNO member since the party 's formative year in 1946 , claimed the UMNO had now been made a party to merely recognize Badawi as UMNO president and accord importance to the prime minister 's family interests , with the nation 's welfare taking a backseat .
1502565	`` The UMNO of today no longer holds to the party 's founding goals when it was formed 62 years ago .
1502566	That is why I have no hesitation whatsoever to leave the party , '' said Mahathir , who was expelled from the UMNO in 1969 for breaching party discipline when he criticized the then party leadership led by Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj .
1502567	Mahathir was readmitted into the UMNO in 1972 .
1502568	Mahathir also invited UMNO members , who shared his stand on the current UMNO leadership , to do the same but not to join another party .
1502569	`` I believe this way will be effective .
1502570	I will not ask people to do something that I myself dare not do it , '' Malaysian national news agency Bernama quoted Mahathir as saying .
1502571	The former prime minister also expressed his disappointment over UMNO members being prevented by the party leadership from meeting him .
1502572	Mahathir said he believed his move to leave the UMNO would not have an impact on the politics of the Malays .
1502573	`` I was once thrown out of the UMNO and the Malay politics did not fade away .
1502574	If the Malays want to correct the situation , it 's not because of my quitting .
1502575	If they are brave to save the party and the party 's struggles , they must be brave to act , '' he said .
1502576	Mahathir reiterated that Badawi must relinquish his prime minister 's post to ensure UMNO 's survival and if necessary , UMNO members can pass a vote of no confidence to force Badawi to step down .
1502577	Asked whether his latest move to quit the UMNO was to apply pressure on Abdullah , Dr Mahathir said : `` I do n't know about pressure because this man does n't seem to understand anything . ''
1728221	KINSHASA , Oct. 23 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB-
1728222	The Democratic Republic of Congo -LRB- DRC -RRB- has issued a local militia group in the east of the country with a 48-hour ultimatum to stop fighting and return to reintegration centers .
1728223	`` I have received the order to give them 48 hours , '' said Colonel Delphin Kayimbi , operations commander of government forces in North Kivu , adding he was ready to act against the Mai Mai , which is led by former senior army officer Kabamba Kasereka .
1728224	Kayimbi , who was speaking on the Top Congo radio , said the army had no connection whatsoever with the militia group .
1728225	The militia was in fact hampering his efforts to deal effectively and decisively with dissident forces loyal to renegade Tutsi General Laurent Nkunda , Kayimbi said .
1728226	DRC 's regular troops have been fighting rebels loyal to Nkunda , who are holed up in the troubled North-Kivu Province since August .
1728227	`` We do not need help from the Mai Mai in any of the operations that we are currently undertaking , '' the colonel said , adding `` if this deadline is not met , then we will have no choice but to disarm this militia forcefully . ''
1728228	The Mai Mai is an independent militia group , which according to Nkunda , has recruited former Interahamwe fighters , who fled into eastern DRC after being implicated in the 1994 Rwandese genocide , into its ranks .
1728229	The militia , which is mainly active in North and South-Kivu provinces , had over the weekend attacked Buganaga , a border town on DRC 's eastern frontier with Uganda , which is held by forces loyal to Nkunda .
1728230	Besides forcing thousands of civilians to flee their homes , including 8,000 reportedly flowing into Uganda , the resultant violence also wore out the army 's patience with the militia group .

1992204	A Taiwanese entrepreneur in the Philippines donated 60 wheelchairs Saturday to a charity organization in Bulacan province , a sign of the concern shown by Taiwan for the disabled in the Philippines .
1992205	Alex Ting , the donor and chairman of the Taiwan Association -LRB- Phils -RRB- Inc. , said he hoped `` the donation can be a gesture that will lead to greater concern for people in need in the Philippines and improve their level of social welfare . ''
1992206	Ting personally pledged to donate another 240 wheelchairs during his term as chairman and said 200 more would be donated by the association .
1992207	Ting also promised to continue his support for a program proposed by his predecessor , Huang Shih-kai , and co-sponsored by Taiwan 's Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation to provide free treatment for children with cleft lips as well as other free medical services to Filipinos .
1992208	Wu Hsin-hsing , the head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines who attended the ceremony marking the donation of the wheelchairs , commended Ting 's generosity as a bridge that `` indeed helps strengthen harmonious relations between Taiwan and the Philippines . ''
1992209	The ceremony was held at the Barcie International Center of the University of Regina Carmeli .
1992210	Veronica Gonzales , chairwoman of the Buklod Lingap Bulacan Foundation , immediately sent the wheelchairs to 60 disabled people chosen by the Social Welfare and Development Office of Bulacan .

2028885	Summer vacation can be a headache for parents , many of whom agonize over what activities to organize for their children so they dont fritter away their free time .
2028886	Having their children study English overseas is a favorite choice for these hard-driving parents , but paying hundreds of thousands of Taiwan dollars for a trip to distant North America makes that options less than palatable for many of them .
2028887	Enter the Philippines , a safe and fun English-speaking environment close to Taiwan where children can learn English efficiently without burning a hole in their parentspockets .
2028888	With English-study tours to the Philippines costing a mere third of the price of similar tours to Canada or the United States , it has become a destination favored by Taiwanese looking to pursue a short-term English-learning experience .
2028889	And it is no wonder why Cebu , one of the 7,107 islands that make up the Philippines and the second largest city of the country , would be the number one choice when it comes to studying English in the Philippines , as Cebu is famous for its hospitality , natural wonders , and affordable lifestyle .
2028890	Roger Kao , vice general manager of Journey Language Education Center -LRB- JLEC -RRB- an agency that sells study tour packages to Cebu , said that compared to other native English-speaking countries such as Australia , Canada , England , the United States and New Zealand , Cebu is the newest hotspot for English learning because it is relatively cheap without compromising on quality .
2028891	Studying in Cebu is a real bargain , Kao said in an interview with the Central News Agency .
2028892	With only one third of the price for a 21-day study tour in Canada , students can easily find their language skills improved in a country full of fun and just a 2-1\/2 hour flight away .
2028893	According to Kao , a 21-day study tour to Canada costs NT$ 170,000-200 ,000 -LRB- US$ 5,666-6 ,666 -RRB- , while JLECs packages to Cebu s noted the Cleverlearn English Language Institute -LRB- CELI -RRB- and the Cebu Pacific International Language School -LRB- CPILS -RRB- cost around NT$ 70,000 .
2028894	With the cost of air travel soaring due to high fuel prices , Kao said a growing numver of parents are deciding to send their children to Cebu instead of Western countries .
2028895	The economic downturn and inflation in Taiwan have definitely played a role in the change , and that is why my company has seen steady growth in the number of students going to study English in Cebu , Kao said .
2028896	As of June , JLEC has sent 60 students to Cebu , doubled the number during the same period last year , with 80-90 percent of them repeat clients who have opted for longer courses from two months to six months instead of two to four weeks .
2028897	Another factor that makes Cebu more appealing to those who would like to learn English is that they can start courses every Monday , while tradition study tours are confined to set periods of time and require a minimum number of students to be held , Kao said .
2028898	Also , both CELI and CPILS have business English programs suitable for those who would like to improve their English proficiency on job , Kao said .
2028899	He thinks all the factors mentioned above make Cebu a more attractive English - learning destination than western countries .
2028900	Yvonne Neddo , information officer of the Taipei-based Manila Economic and Cultural Office -LRB- MECO -RRB- , told CNA that the Philippines government also plays an important role in promoting English-learning programs in the country .
2028901	The MECO in Taipei started the promotion of ESL programs at the end of 2006 and we have seen steady growth year by year with the number of students doubling each year , Neddo said .
2028902	She said MECO is actively involved in the promotion by holding seminars and visiting universities in Taiwan .
2028903	Last March , we worked with Taichung City Governments Culture Bureau to invite senior high schools and universities to participate in the promotion seminar , Neddo said .
2028904	Ming Chuan University , for example , has sign a memorandum of understanding to send 32 students to study English at CELI in October and engage in further language exchange programs between the two , according to Neddo .
2028905	She said that Cebus English-learning programs have been well - accepted in other Asian countries , such as South Korea and Japan , and therefore MECO will step up its efforts to increase Taiwanese peoples awareness of the advantages of studying English in Philippines .

2212251	The Philippines government has been setting up special economic zones and providing incentives such as tax exemptions in a bid to attract more foreign investors , officials at an investment opportunities seminar told participants in Taipei Monday .
2212252	The Philippine Investment Opportunities Seminar was held by the Manila Economic and Cultural Office -LRB- MECO -RRB- in Taiwan and the Philippine Department of Trade and Industry -LRB- DTI -RRB- in Taipei Monday with the aim of attracting Taiwanese investors to the Philippines .
2212253	Speaking at the seminar , Philippine Economic Zone Authority -LRB- PEZA -RRB- Director - General Lilia B. de Lima , who is also the undersecretary of his country 's Department of Trade and Industry -LRB- DTI -RRB- , gave a detailed description of the Philippines investment environment .
2212254	`` Over the past years , we have attracted many large investments to the Philippines , '' said Lima .
2212255	`` Large manufacturers in the world , such as electronics , household appliance , computer hardware and garment makers , have set up factories in our country . ''
2212256	Noting that in 2007 , the Philippines posted economic growth of 7.3 percent , the highest in three decades , Lima urged Taiwan investors to take advantage of the incentives being offered by countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -LRB- ASEAN -RRB- free trade group .
2212257	`` The original member countries of the ASEAN Free Trade Area -LRB- AFTA -RRB- , which includes the Philippines , Thailand , Indonesia , Singapore , Malaysia and Brunei , will lower their tariffs to near zero , thus removing trade barriers within AFTA in the year 2010 , '' Lima said .
2212258	AFTA 's four new member countries , Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia and Myanmar , will do the same in 2015 , he added .
2212259	`` Therefore if Taiwan businesses do not have factories set up within these countries , then tariff-wise , it will be a great disadvantage to Taiwan entrepreneurs , '' said Lima .
2212260	`` I recommend the Philippines as a great place for Taiwan businessmen to set up factories so that tariffs may be avoided . ''
2212261	According to MECO , other incentives offered by the Philippines government for foreigners who want to invest in the country include a special investor 's Residence Visa that can be extended to immediate members of the family and income tax holidays -LRB- ITH -RRB- of 6 years for pioneer firms and 4 years for non - pioneer firms .
2212262	After the ITH period expires , there will be an option to pay a special 5 percent tax on gross income , in lieu of national and local taxes , it added .
2212263	During the investment seminar , undersecretary of the Philippines Department of Tourism Phineas Alburo said that the country 's tourism industry has experienced rapid growth in recent years .
2212264	`` In the past five years , the number of tourists visiting the Philippines has grown by 12.9 percent , '' said Alburo .
2212265	`` In the year 2007 alone , the number of tourists coming to our country topped 3 million . ''
2212266	Alburo said that the tourism industry is the biggest source of income for the Philippines .
2212267	`` Right now , the Philippines ' tourism industry is still growing at an astonishing pace , '' said Alburo .
2212268	`` Therefore , the hotels and resorts in Philippines require large amounts of capital investment so that they could expand and satisfy the growing demand . ''
2212269	According to Alburo , business opportunities in the Philippine hospitality industry is on the upswing , as hotel and resort occupancy rates in major tourist destinations reached 75-80 percent on a year round basis .
2212270	As a result , investments in the tourism industry have been flowing into the country , he added .
2212271	According to statistics provided by MECO , the Philippines Department of Tourism in 2006 approved investments totalling a record high 93.8 billion Philippine pesos -LRB- about US$ 2.08 billion -RRB- , and in the first quarter of 2007 approved investments of 9.52 billion Philippine pesos -LRB- or about US$ 210 million -RRB- .
2212272	Major international groups such as Banyan Tree , Marriott Hotel and Raffles Hotel are starting to invest in the Philippines , MECO added .
2212273	Also , a consortium made up of the Trump Organization -- headed by American business Mogul Donald Trump -- American Westgate Resorts Asia Ltd. and the Korean Heung-A Property Group will be investing in a US$ 1 billion tourism project in Subic Bay in the Philippines , MECO stated .
2212274	Alburo said that the Philippines government continues to focus on the requirements of the tourism industry by putting in place major infrastructure projects such as international and domestic airports , seaports and roadways to connect the 7,107 islands of the Philippines .
2212275	In the absence of formal diplomatic ties , MECO is the de-facto embassy of the Republic of Philippines in Taiwan , handling trade and cultural exchanges between the two countries .
2591198	When a military parent is deployed to a combat zone , the children left behind might be plagued by more than frightening dreams and aching hearts .
2591199	A new study funded by the U.S. Army found that child abuse and neglect was about 40 percent higher in Army households during combat-related deployment than during non-deployment -- and that civilian mothers are significantly more likely to mistreat their children than civilian fathers .
2591200	Researchers in North Carolina tracked nearly 1,800 Army families with at least one substantiated incident of `` child maltreatment '' through periods of deployment and non-deployment from 2001 to 2004 .
2591201	The study , one of the first to examine child mistreatment in military families during deployment , found that the rate of physical abuse by female civilian parents was nearly twice as great during times of deployment .
2591202	The rate of child neglect by civilian mothers was nearly four times higher during deployments .
2591203	However , the rate of child mistreatment was not significantly elevated for male civilian parents during deployment .
2591204	Deborah A. Gibbs , lead author of the study and a senior analyst with RTI International , an independent , nonprofit research institute in North Carolina , said the report was part of a larger study of family violence in the military .
2591205	The child mistreatment portion of the study emerged when many soldiers were being deployed to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , Gibbs said .
2591206	`` It 's easy to imagine that deployments would increase stress on the parent who is left behind , '' she said .
2591207	Gibbs said moderate to severe mistreatment of children was about 60 percent higher during deployment .
2591208	She said the ratings of moderate and severe mistreatment depend both on the risk of harm to the child and the actual harm .
2591209	For example , mild abuse could be inappropriate discipline ; severe abuse could be an action that results in significant injury .
2591210	Gibbs said the findings were generally consistent across age , rank and ethnic groups .
2591211	James E. McCarroll , director of the Family Violence Research Project in the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress at Uniform Services University of the Health Sciences in Maryland , said the study confirms other research , including his own .
2591212	The study 's results did not surprise Michelle Joyner , director of communications for the Virginia-based National Military Family Association , a nonprofit advocacy group that focuses on quality of life issues for military families .
2591213	`` We know in our dealings with military families that families are tired , '' she said .
2591214	Gibbs said recent research suggested the rates of child abuse and neglect in military families were lower than in the general population prior to large-scale deployments .
2591215	But when deployments increased , the rate of mistreatment in the military population rose sharply and eventually became higher than in the civilian population .
2591216	While most military families do a `` tremendous job '' of handling the stress of deployment , she said many still need access to additional services , like child care and support groups .
2988621	But 15 years ago , McCain himself startled colleagues by proposing to cut off money for struggling and embattled U.S. forces in another perilous place : Somalia .
2988622	On the 2008 campaign trail , McCain is seen as an unyielding hawk .
2988623	But before his first presidential run in 2000 , he declared he would work with the Democratic Party to devise foreign policy .
2988624	And while he now describes himself as a `` foot soldier in the Reagan revolution , '' he infuriated Republicans as a freshman congressman in 1983 by trying to thwart President Reagan 's deployment of troops in Lebanon .
2988625	Now the presumptive GOP nominee for president , McCain has adopted a surprising diversity of views on foreign policy issues during his 25 years in Congress , a pattern that brings uncertainty to the path he would take if elected .
2988626	McCain , an ex-Navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner of war who has built his campaign around his national security expertise , has advanced views on Iraq and Iran that are tough and assertive and that seem to put him in the neoconservative camp .
2988627	Yet , McCain has on many occasions resisted calls for use of U.S. troops .
2988628	Even now , he adopts positions that are closer to traditional , pragmatic Republicans than hawkish neocons .
2988629	One sign of the contradictions in his views is the friction between rival camps of McCain supporters -- between neoconservatives and those with pragmatic views , called `` realists . ''
2988630	Both sides believe McCain will follow their path and that like-minded allies will have key roles in the new his administration .
2988631	The conflicting signals have caught the attention of foreign policy experts .
2988632	`` Who is the real John McCain ? ''
2988633	asked Dmitri Simes , president of the Nixon Center , a Washington , D.C. , think tank and stronghold of the realists .
2988634	Simes said McCain , one of the Nixon Center 's advisers , has privately assured prominent supporters in the traditional foreign policy camp that , `` His more exuberant statements do n't necessarily reflect his real views . ''
2988635	`` John is a traditional national security guy , '' said retired Adm. Bobby Ray Inman , a former top intelligence official who is an important supporter .
2988636	When McCain reaches the White House , Inman predicts , `` There 's going to be a lot of disappointment on the neoconservative side . ''
2988637	In forming his views on national security , McCain has always relied on a large circle of outside advisers and a handful of trusted aides .
2988638	But he has typically worked out his own conclusions .
2988639	And , taken as a whole , they seem quirky and a la carte , rather than growing from a single philosophy .
2988640	From his father , an admiral who served in World War II , he has inherited the view that the United States must preserve its image of strength and greatness , not backing down from lesser opponents .
2988641	At the same time , McCain 's beliefs have been colored by his time as a Navy aviator , when he and his buddies became convinced that civilian leaders in Washington , D.C. , were dangerously mishandling the Vietnam War .
2988642	Even while he wants to extend American authority , McCain as a lawmaker has regularly bucked the Republican establishment .
2988643	The Lebanon vote was an example .
2988644	In 1983 , as a House freshman , McCain voted against a bill to extend Reagan 's deployment of U.S. troops there .
2988645	Reagan wanted more time to strengthen the fragile Lebanese government , but McCain worried that the American force was too small and that U.S. interests did not justify the risk .
2988646	In a similar vein , when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 , McCain initially wanted to limit the response to an air war .
2988647	`` To start putting American troops into that kind of meat grinder I just do n't think is a viable option , '' McCain said at the time .
2988648	But he quickly changed his view , voting five months later to join an international effort to push Saddam out of Kuwait .
2988649	Three years later , after 18 Army Rangers were killed in in Mogadishu , Somalia , McCain decided that it was time to withdraw the troops and he introduced an amendment to cut off funds .
2988650	He wrote later that he regretted the step as an encroachment on the president 's power and `` as a retreat in the face of aggression from an inferior foe . ''
2988651	McCain opposed the U.S. military intervention in Haiti in 1993 .
2988652	Like then-President Clinton , he was reluctant to intervene in Bosnia in 1993 and 1994 .
2988653	After the Dayton peace accord in 1995 , McCain supported the administration 's plan to send U.S. peacekeepers into the region , with some reservations .
2988654	Growing bolder in his advocacy of U.S. deployments , McCain in 1999 favored American force -- even ground troops -- to halt the `` ethnic cleansing '' of Albanians in the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo .
2988655	McCain was moving closer to the muscular interventionism advanced by analysts like William Kristol and Robert Kagan , friends and advisers generally considered neoconservatives .
2988656	He began giving greater emphasis to the idea that the United States needed to assert itself abroad to promote its values , not just narrow national interests .
2988657	`` He clearly was moving closer to the neocons , '' said Simes .
2988658	By the time the 2000 election campaign got underway , `` They were already quite enthusiastic about him , '' Simes said .
2988659	Yet McCain kept close ties among his old-school realists , including Kissinger , former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage .
2988660	They thought he was on their side , too .
2988661	In 2002 , when debate erupted over war with Iraq , McCain seemed to strengthen his identity as a neoconservative .
2988662	He agreed with administration officials that Saddamwas trying to restart his nuclear weapons program , and he urged the United States to give more money to controversial financier Ahmad Chalabi of the Iraqi National Congress and other Iraqi exiles .
2988663	He predicted that regime change in Iraq could catalyze sweeping democratic change in the region .
2988664	McCain has staked out a more hawkish position on Iran than the Bush administration , saying that , `` The only thing worse than military action against Iran is a nuclear-armed Iran . ''
2988665	But McCain has sent conflicting signals , as well .
2988666	In 1998 , he suggested to the Weekly Standard magazine that as president he would develop a consensus foreign policy , consulting the `` best minds I know , '' including President Carter 's national security adviser , Zbigniew Brzezinski ; Clinton administration Secretary of State Warren Christopher ; President George H.W. Bush 's Secretary of State James A. Baker III , and Kissinger .
2988667	McCain has been tough on Russia , calling for world powers to eject the country from the G-8 group of industrial nations and disparaging former President Vladimir Putin .
2988668	But he has taken a pragmatic position on China , a country that does not follow U.S. human rights practices but is far more vital to its prosperity .
2988669	Hawkish toward toward North Korea , McCain said in the mid-1990s that the United States should consider military action to stop Pyongyang 's nuclear program .
2988670	Recently , however , he has toned down his comments .
2988671	McCain has supported the idea of a `` League of Democracies , '' a coalition that might substitute for the United Nations and use military force .
2988672	Critics view the idea as a dangerous neocon scheme that could alienate Russia , China and Saudi Arabia and further polarize the world .
2988673	At the same time , he has been generally positive about the role of the United Nations .
2988674	McCain has favored strengthening NATO and ties to European allies , and has spent time cultivating European leaders .
2988675	Randy Scheunemann , McCain 's chief foreign policy adviser , rejects the idea that McCain has moved to a more neoconservative position in recent years , and , indeed , rejects the term `` neoconservative '' as meaningless .
2988676	He said the differences on foreign policy among McCain 's supporters reflect not that he has taken many views , but simply his wide appeal .
2988677	`` John McCain unites the Republican foreign policy spectrum , '' says Scheunemann .
2988678	`` They 're almost all supporters . ''

3405452	LOS ANGELES -- At 4 p.m. on June 8 , Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa issued a terse statement announcing that he and his wife Corina were separating after 20 years of marriage .
3405453	Two hours later , Telemundo television anchor Mirthala Salinas delivered the story to her Spanish-language viewers on the Friday evening news .
3405454	`` The rumors were true , '' she declared of the split after an introduction that described the story as a `` political scandal '' that had left `` many people with their mouth open . ''
3405455	What Salinas did not say in the newscast was that she was the other woman .
3405456	She and Villaraigosa had been in a relationship even though she had been the political reporter assigned to cover local politics and the mayor .
3405457	On Tuesday , prompted by a report in the Daily News of Los Angeles , Villaraigosa officially confirmed what had long been whispered around City Hall .
3405458	`` I have a relationship with Ms. Salinas , and I take full responsibility for my actions , '' he said at a news conference after a swearing-in ceremony for new school board members at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion downtown .
3405459	By late afternoon , the Telemundo anchor had issued her own confirmation .
3405460	`` I first got to know the mayor at a professional level where we went on to become friends , '' she said .
3405461	`` The current relationship grew out of our existing friendship . ''
3405462	Salinas said that while she and the mayor `` are both public figures , I hope that everyone can understand and respect my desire to maintain my privacy when it comes to personal relationships . ''
3405463	Villaraigosa 's admission cast a fresh shadow over his own personal conduct : He has two adult daughters born out of wedlock , and his wife filed for divorce in 1994 over a separate affair for which he later publicly apologized .
3405464	They eventually reconciled .
3405465	It may also have damaged his carefully honed image as a family man , something he has reinforced over the years by appearing with his family in campaign literature and -- until this week -- on the city 's Web site .
3405466	And it is unclear how the political fallout will treat one of the region 's most recognizable figures .
3405467	The revelation also raised ethical questions about Salinas ' decision to become involved with a politician she was covering as a journalist .
3405468	Several media analysts condemned the relationship as a conflict for her and the mayor and suggested that Salinas ' bosses should have taken immediate action to remove her from handling any Villaraigosa coverage .
3405469	`` There really is no question that this is unacceptable , '' said Kelly McBride , ethics group leader at The Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg , Fla. `` You ca n't sleep with your sources .
3405470	This one sort of transcends the boundaries in any ethical newsroom . ''
3405471	Telemundo executives defended Salinas and noted that she had been moved in August 2006 from her City Hall job to cover general assignment stories and serve as a back-up anchor .
3405472	`` Mirthala Salinas is one of our most respected reporters and a great professional , '' said Manuel Abud , Telemundo 's general manager in Los Angeles .
3405473	`` Telemundo is fully committed to journalistic excellence .
3405474	Everyday we strive for the highest standards of journalistic ethics and make every effort to protect our objectivity and avoid possible conflicts of interest . ''
3405475	Villaraigosa , who called Salinas a `` consummate journalistic professional , '' said she decided about a year ago that `` our friendship had grown to a point where it was necessary to inform her management that she should not cover me .
3405476	She did that .
3405477	And they agreed . ''
3405478	The Los Angeles Times traced their relationship back at least 18 months .
3405479	In November 2005 -- four months after he was sworn into office -- Villaraigosa was seen one evening by a resident of the Sherman Oaks condominium complex where Salinas lived at the time .
3405480	Jean Rouda recalled pulling into the garage about 9 p.m. and seeing Villaraigosa standing alone and buzzing to get into the building .
3405481	Rouda said she recognized the mayor and was surprised that he had no security guards and that there was no limousine parked nearby .
3405482	She said she and her niece entered the lobby , where they encountered Villaraigosa , who was wearing a dress shirt and slacks , and was carrying bags of takeout food and a bottle of wine .
3405483	The two women and Villaraigosa hopped into the elevator .
3405484	He extended his hand to Rouda and introduced himself as `` Antonio . ''
3405485	`` I look at him and go , ` I know who you are .
3405486	I know who you 're going to see .
3405487	Tell her I say ` hi , ' '' she recalled .
3405488	Rouda said she was certain that Villaraigosa was visiting Salinas because everyone else in the 15-unit complex was `` older and Jewish '' except for her .
3405489	`` I knew he was not going to visit an elderly Jewish woman with wine and food , '' she said .
3405490	Rouda , a self-described news junkie , said she recalled the chance encounter because it was the night before the funeral of Rosa Parks in Detroit , which she saw reported on television and noticed Villaraigosa had attended .
3405491	Rouda said she chose at the time not to tell anyone about meeting the mayor because she thought it was a private matter .
3405492	She spoke only after Times reporters contacted her recently .
3405493	Salinas subsequently moved to another condo in Studio City .
3405494	In the meantime , Villaraigosa and Salinas also crossed paths professionally over the next year .
3405495	On March 20 , 2006 , Salinas traveled to New York to cover Villaraigosa , who was visiting Mayor Michael Bloomberg to discuss education reform .
3405496	Three months later , she went to Sacramento to cover Villaraigosa as he stumped for legislation to give him some control of Los Angeles public schools .
3405497	Salinas covered a news conference and appears alongside the mayor in pictures snapped by a Times photographer .
3405498	One of the photographs ran in the newspaper and caught the attention of Villaraigosa 's staff , who knew of their building relationship and privately worried that word of the affair might leak out .
3405499	Then in September 2006 , Villaraigosa played a direct role in the medical care of Salinas ' mother , Yolanda Avila Fernandez , who was being treated for cancer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center , according to sources familiar with her case .
3405500	The mayor consulted with doctors on a regular basis and appeared in Fernandez 's hospital room with her family on the eighth floor of the complex 's north tower , serving as an emotional anchor and an unofficial spokesman for Salinas and her siblings .
3405501	Fernandez was eventually transferred to USC\/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center east of downtown , where a doctor described the mayor as `` a model citizen . ''
3405502	Fernandez died Jan. 4 of this year .
3405503	Two days later , Villaraigosa flew to Phoenix to attend weekend memorial services for her at the Greer-Wilson Funeral Home .
3405504	`` He did come for services , '' said Eddie Lopez , the funeral home 's general manager .
3405505	`` I remember him being there . ''
3405506	All along , Villaraigosa and his aides remained silent about the relationship .
3405507	Then in late January , rumors about the Villaraigosa 's shaky marriage picked up after a local Internet blog reported that the mayor and his wife had separated .
3405508	In an interview with the Times , Villaraigosa denied the report , which was fueled by the fact that he had stopped wearing his wedding ring , a point cited in the blog item .
3405509	Aides said Villaraigosa , who had lost weight , stopped wearing the ring because it was slipping off .
3405510	He was wearing it during the interview .
3405511	The last time Villaraigosa spoke publicly about his personal life was June 11 , when he held a news conference to talk about the split with Corina Villaraigosa .
3405512	At the time , he would only say that he felt a `` personal sense of failure '' about the breakup and hoped everyone would respect his family 's privacy .
3405513	The next day , she filed for divorce .
3405514	But speculation continued to build about Salinas , whose name and picture appeared on Internet blogs , along with allegations that she was pregnant .
3405515	Asked Tuesday whether Salinas is pregnant , Villaraigosa said : `` I can tell you emphatically that that question is outrageous and the answer is no , she is not pregnant . ''
3405516	Villaraigosa is not the first politician to be linked to Salinas .
3405517	California Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez , D-Los Angeles , confirmed in a recent interview that he dated Salinas in 2003 when he was divorced from his wife ; the two have since remarried .
3405518	Nunez is a longtime Villaraigosa friend and political ally .
3405519	Salinas has worked as a radio and television journalist in Los Angeles and Phoenix for more than 13 years , according to her Telemundo biography .
3405520	She covered the `` political beat '' until she disclosed her relationship with the mayor .
3405521	Her duties were then expanded to include general assignment stories , working as a backup anchor and on the 11 p.m. news , according to a statement from the station and company spokesman Alfredo Richard .
3405522	She has been filling in as the anchor on the 6 p.m. news for the last few months while the regular anchor , Lucia Navarro , is on maternity leave .
3405523	Salinas did not anchor the broadcast Tuesday night but did appear in file footage in Telemundo 's news report of her relationship with Villaraigosa .
3405524	On Tuesday , most members of the City Council either declined to comment on Villaraigosa 's confirmation or said that it was his own business .
3405525	Times staff writers Hector Bercerra , Anna Gorman and Sam Quinones and researcher John Tyrrell contributed to this report .
3521837	And he keeps getting better .
3521838	Last season , the 7-year-old , 1,350-pound bull shaved his time to 3.48 seconds ; this month , he trotted out of Madison Square Garden in New York as the top - ranked bull in the 2008 Versus Invitational , the opening event in bull riding 's major leagues .
3521839	But these days , with steroid scandals clouding many top sports , doubts waft like sawdust in the bullring too , and Big Bucks finds himself facing a question about what makes him a winner :
3521840	Is it the Mexican fighting bull in him , the Brahman influence , his Texas upbringing -- or something else ?
3521841	Big Bucks has n't ducked the question -- instead submitting to a needle-wielding veterinarian and making history in the process as the first bucking bull to be tested for anabolic steroids under the Professional Bull Riders ' new plan to keep the sport clean .
3521842	Dogged by internal rumblings that bull owners seek an advantage in the arena by injecting the creatures with steroids , the association recently decided it was time to ferret out the truth .
3521843	A number of people in the industry speculate that steroids were used on competitive bulls in the past -LRB- at least one owner acknowledges having done so -RRB- but that the practice fell out of favor as owners realized they were trading short-term gains for long-term losses .
3521844	`` Our sport has hung its hat along the lines of true competition and honor and grit , '' said Matthew Rivela , general counsel for the Professional Bull Riders Inc. , based in Pueblo .
3521845	`` We want to ensure the integrity of the sport . ''
3521846	Although casual observers of rodeo understand that riders get points for staying on a bull , they might not know that the system works in the opposite direction too : Bulls get points for how high they kick and how tough a time they give the rider -- and fame and fortune come to owners of the animals that do it best .
3521847	Bull owners can win bonuses ranging from $ 1,250 to $ 20,000 for a world champion .
3521848	Big Bucks , a past world champion , is a celebrity in his universe .
3521849	His owners say he 's steroid-free and do n't mind that he is the first to undergo testing -- they just do n't want him to be unfairly singled out .
3521850	Testing for steroids is becoming more common in horse racing , but it 's virtually unheard of in the rodeo world .
3521851	Neither the International Professional Rodeo Association nor the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association tests animals , and their officials said they had n't heard of anyone else taking the PBR 's approach .
3521852	It 's a decision that will prompt some internal discussions , said Cindy Schonholtz , animal welfare coordinator for the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association in Colorado Springs , Colo.
3521853	Despite their pursuit of testing , PBR officials say they do n't expect to find many , if any , problems .
3521854	Steroids might not have been uncommon about a decade ago , they believe , but usage probably tapered as owners realized the downside : sterility that rendered the bulls useless as breeders .
3521855	`` I just do n't think there 's a lot of abuse out there , '' said Texas veterinarian Gary Warner , who works closely with PBR and helped develop a bull steroid test .
3521856	Although steroids could make a bull more aggressive -- possibly desirable in the arena -- they probably do n't make him bigger , Warner said , primarily because once the steroid is injected , the bull ca n't be forced to work out to build muscle .
3521857	Even if the bull did bulk up , that 's not an advantage in the ring , Warner said .
3521858	`` These guys have to express athleticism more like a dancer .
3521859	They 're graded on how high they kick , how tight a circle they move in . ''
3521860	But good performers sometimes face accusations , he said .
3521861	`` That 's where rumor mills get started , and management gets caught in the middle , '' Warner said .
3521862	`` I know those cowboys , and they 're awful good folks .
3521863	But who 's to know ?
3521864	My hat 's off to PBR .
3521865	It will solve the problem of everyone pointing the finger . ''
3521866	As far as Texas bull owner Jerry Nelson is concerned , steroid use is `` still an issue . ''
3521867	-LRB- Begin optional trim -RRB-
3521868	`` You can tell by looking at some of those bulls and their sizes .
3521869	It 's just like human beings .
3521870	You can tell who 's on it and who ai n't , '' he said .
3521871	A part-owner of Big Bucks , he sends hundreds of bulls to PBR competitions .
3521872	`` To make the bulls bigger , faster , meaner with a needle can make you more money , '' Nelson said .
3521873	-LRB- End optional trim -RRB-
3521874	A decade ago , he found himself with a couple of bulls that would n't put on weight , he said .
3521875	`` I could feed them like pigs and they would n't muscle up .
3521876	My vet suggested we could put them on steroids , '' he said .
3521877	So he did .
3521878	The drugs made his bulls bigger and meaner , Nelson said -- but they also rendered the animals sterile .
3521879	`` We quit -- it 's not worth it , '' he said .
3521880	PBR officials decided to implement the policy this year by testing the top-performing bulls at random events in the 2008 Built Ford Tough Series , its premier tour .
3521881	In the future they might conduct the random tests on bulls regardless of their performance , Rivela said .
3521882	He said the organization had n't settled yet on the penalty for steroid users but did n't intend to suspend violators this year .
3521883	Monetary fines are possible , Rivela said .
3521884	Nelson chafes at the idea that only winners , like his Big Bucks , are scrutinized .
3521885	`` If they 're going to test one bull , they need to test them all , '' he said .
3521886	That 's not to say he 's worried about Big Bucks ' test results , which wo n't be available for another month .
3521887	He 'll be clean , Nelson said .
3521888	If he 's not , Nelson said , he 'll be crying foul that someone tampered with his bull .
3521889	`` I 'm going to be like Roger Clemens on ` 60 Minutes , ' screaming like hell , '' he said .
3795686	FORT MCMURRAY , Alberta
3795687	The Aurora Mine exudes the odor of petroleum and the look of untapped riches .
3795688	The open pit mine plunges 250 feet deep and ranges over a couple of square miles , carved out of pine and spruce forest by gigantic machines that operate 24\/7 , even in the dark of winter at 40 degrees below zero .
3795689	This is the heart of Alberta 's oil sands , a remote Florida-sized region where moose , bears and beavers inhabit watery woodlands atop the world 's largest proven petroleum reserves outside Saudi Arabia .
3795690	The unusual deposits -- where oil is locked in the tarry soil rather than pooled beneath the surface -- are yielding a bonanza of investment dollars , government revenue and jobs .
3795691	Almost half of Canada 's oil production comes from the oil sands -- and the energy industry estimates that enough oil can be extracted to fill the country 's needs for three centuries .
3795692	The vast majority of Canadian oil exports goes to the United States , and the Bush administration sees the remaining resources as America 's best hope for reducing dependence on Middle Eastern oil .
3795693	`` No single thing can do more to help us reach that goal than realizing the potential of the oil sands , '' U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said during a visit last July .
3795694	The benefits might be great , but the toll on other natural resources is also enormous .
3795695	Separating petroleum from sand burns so much natural gas that the enterprise is becoming Canada 's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions growth .
3795696	The oil sands lie within a major intact ecosystem , the boreal forest covering almost one-third of Canada 's land mass .
3795697	The forest is one of the world 's biggest freshwater storehouses and absorbs a vast amount of carbon dioxide .
3795698	It also provides habitat for hundreds of species of birds and is home to caribous , wolves and bears .
3795699	Expansion of the oil sands operations could tear huge holes in a forest already rent by logging , oil and gas exploration and other industries .
3795700	With development expected to triple , or even quintuple , in the next few decades , producers and government officials puzzle over how to harness the oil sands ' potential with less cost to the climate , land , water and the well-being of native peoples who fear that cancer cases in a downstream community might be a sign of lethal industrial pollution .
3795701	Current leases for open-pit mining cover an area several times the size of New York City , according to the Pembina Institute , an environmental research group in Alberta .
3795702	But more than 50,000 square miles are potentially available for various types of oil extraction , which has prompted environmentalists to call for stopping development until ecological effects can be reduced .
3795703	`` The very nature of oil sands means that developing them ... causes an incredible disruption to land and landscape over immense areas , '' said a March report by the House of Commons natural resources committee .
3795704	Although the U.S. is the primary market for the oil , pressure for development also comes from Chinese companies that have been investing hundreds of millions of dollars in leases .
3795705	Cavernous pit mines account for the bulk of the 1.2 million barrels of oil generated daily in a region with an estimated 174 billion barrels in reserve .
3795706	Syncrude Canada Ltd. , a joint venture that includes Exxon Mobil Corp.-controlled Imperial Oil Resources , has 8,000 workers ; it spent $ 4.2 billion last year and has invested billions more in capital improvements .
3795707	`` It is not a business for the faint of heart , '' spokesman Alain Moore said .
3795708	At Syncrude 's Aurora Mine , dozens of electric shovels eat away at the tarry deposits .
3795709	With each scoop , the behemoths drop 100 tons of dirt into trucks with beds as big as small houses .
3795710	Amid clouds of dust , the trucks deliver their payload to machinery that crushes and screens it before it is mixed with hot water and piped into a cone-shaped tank .
3795711	A form of petroleum called bitumen rises to the top , then is upgraded in a maze of smoke stacks , pipes and steel structures as high as 23 stories .
3795712	The leftovers are stockpiled on the surrounding landscape .
3795713	Huge yellow blocks of sulfur impurities are stacked pyramid-fashion .
3795714	Dunes of sand expelled from the plant sweep toward the horizon .
3795715	On lake-sized tailings ponds , floating scarecrows and fire from air cannons discourage birds from alighting on the oily wastewater and dying .
3795716	Recovering oil from sand requires the use of natural gas to heat water , which produces greenhouses gases and other air pollutants .
3795717	The water itself is drawn from the 765-mile-long Athabasca River , which flows from glaciers in the Canadian Rockies through numerous small communities and sustains waterfowl , fish and other wildlife .
3795718	Although improved technology and recycling have reduced the amount of water and energy needed for each barrel of oil , Syncrude 's reports show overall quantities growing along with oil production .
3795719	The oil sands operations accounted for 4 percent of Canada 's greenhouse gas emissions in 2005 , and energy regulators say they have been increasing .
3795720	University of Alberta ecologist David Schindler projects that new development , coupled with climate change , could cut the Athabasca River 's low winter flow in half or more by midcentury .
3795721	`` What they want to withdraw is an unsustainable amount , '' he said .
3795722	Alberta environmental officials recently established water-use rules to prevent biological damage to the river , and the provincial government has required a 12 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per barrel of oil .
3795723	But experts at the Pembina Institute maintain that those measures are inadequate .
3795724	The industry , which contributes billions of dollars in economic activity , royalties and taxes each year , says it plans to minimize environmental effects through improved efficiency and through land restoration required by government leases .
3795725	Syncrude reports that it has reclaimed one-quarter of the land disturbed by mining , although the government has not certified the land 's ability to sustain wildlife and plants .
3795726	Greg Stringham , vice president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers , said oil-sands operators were looking at alternatives to natural gas for heating water , including starting controlled fires underground or using nuclear power .
3795727	Some companies , he said , are looking at ways to sequester carbon dioxide underground .
3795728	`` The government does not want to shut down the development because it provides benefits -LRB- to the country -RRB- and revenues to them , '' Stringham said .
3795729	`` All anyone can hope for is the best available technology , not just stop producing oil . ''
3795730	Even people who claim harm from the fallout say the oil boom has its advantages .
3795731	Ivy Simpson , who works at an all-terrain vehicle dealership , developed cervical cancer 10 years ago .
3795732	Simpson believes she was exposed to pollution from oil developments while living in the downstream hamlet of Fort Chipewyan .
3795733	But she later took a job at a mine for about $ 30 an hour -- enough to pay rent and buy a truck .
3795734	`` Being a single mom and recently widowed , I needed the work , and I had to pay the bills , '' said Simpson , 28 .
3795735	`` It 's expensive to live here . ''
3795736	Fort Chipewyan , the oldest settlement in Alberta , is a 50-minute flight and worlds away from Fort McMurray .
3795737	The town 's quiet streets run between dense woods and the rocky shoreline of Lake Athabasca , which receives water from the Athabasca and other rivers .
3795738	`` To have a lake like this and not be able to drink from it is a real shame , '' said Ray Ladouceur , 65 , a commercial fisherman who has caught fish with humped backs , cysts and other deformities .
3795739	`` I call this a red zone , a danger zone , to live in . ''
3795740	An industry-funded water-monitoring program that includes government agencies and environmental groups has studied fish in the river but not the lake .
3795741	`` We see some -LRB- tumors and cysts -RRB- occasionally , '' said Fred Kuzmic , an oil company biologist who heads the program .
3795742	But he said the proportion of observed abnormalities had dropped by more than half since 2005 , when 7 percent of the fish sampled were deformed and that most of the abnormalities probably were caused by scrapes on the swift river 's bottom .
3795743	Dr. John O'Connor , the regional chief of family practice , was disturbed by the fish abnormalities .
3795744	O'Connor said he had seen an alarming number of rare cancers and cases of autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis .
3795745	`` It raised the question , '' he said .
3795746	`` Were the numbers and types of illnesses we were seeing the result of genetics , lifestyle , bad luck or environmental ? ''
3795747	He worried that the oil sands might be an environmental cause .

3795749	O'Connor was especially concerned about a bile duct cancer called cholangiocarcinoma .
3795750	His father had died of the disease , which occurs in about two out of 100,000 people .
3795751	O'Connor was certain of four cases and suspected one or two others in Fort Chipewyan , which has fewer than 1,200 residents .
3795752	Statistics recently compiled by the local nursing station show an increase in mortality and of cancer-related deaths in the last decade .
3795753	Twenty-one residents died last year , eight of cancer .
3795754	After the doctor expressed his concerns in a radio report last year , federal health authorities filed a complaint this year alleging that he was unduly alarming the public .
3795755	The complaint is pending .

3795757	The previous summer , Alberta Health & Wellness had conducted a study that found more cases of certain cancers than expected in Fort Chipewyan , but it concluded that overall cancer levels were not significantly different from elsewhere in the province .
3795758	But local residents and colleagues of O'Connor questioned the thoroughness of the study and accused the government of trying to shut up the doctor to protect the oil industry .
3795759	`` The message for anyone who blows a whistle is you will be clobbered , '' said Dr. Michel Sauve , the regional chief of medicine .
3795760	Provincial water officials say they know of no water pollution from the oil sands , but some elders who once drank directly from the lake now even avoid drinking from remote streams when they hunt and trap .
3795761	Joe Wandering Spirit , 67 , whose one-room cabin is in the bush several miles from town , drinks water collected in a rain barrel , not from the Quatre Fourches River at his doorstep .
3795762	`` Long ago , people never died of cancer , but recently a lot died , '' he said in Cree .
3795763	`` I do n't know if that -LRB- industrial pollution -RRB- is causing illnesses , but it might be , because we do n't really know what the white people are doing at the oil sands .
3795764	... ''

3795766	Recently , Ivy Simpson 's mother , Mary , visited the grave of her own mother , who died of leukemia in 1989 .
3795767	Reflecting on cancer in her town , Mary said , `` Sixty ... years down the line , there will be no more oil , so all these oil companies will leave the aboriginal people here with all our sickness .
3795768	I pity my five grandchildren . ''

3795770	In Fort McKay , which is surrounded by oil mines , tribal Chief Jim Boucher recalled the hard times before the oil sands were developed .
3795771	Worldwide anti-fur campaigns in the mid-1980s had destroyed traditional trapping , and the town of a few hundred was left with the choice between welfare or seeking another economic opportunity .
3795772	`` We decided to work with the resource development sector , '' Boucher said .
3795773	`` I am proud of our ability to make a transition and make a good living . ''
3795774	Besides providing jobs , oil-sands operators contract with several tribal businesses and donate money for education and community facilities .
3795775	But the chief acknowledged his tribe 's deep fears about environmental and health effects .
3795776	`` We have been saying for some time that changes have been happening to land , air , water and wildlife , '' Boucher said .
3795777	`` The one thing we do n't appreciate is being the canary in the coal mine for the oil industry . ''
3856087	For almost 20 years , Susan Fisher Sterling has watched visitors come into the National Museum of Women in the Arts to study the works of Frida Kahlo , Mary Cassatt , Georgia O'Keeffe and Elizabeth Catlett .
3856088	Last week she took charge of what future visitors might encounter at the country 's only museum dedicated to female artists .
3856089	Sterling , 52 , the chief curator and deputy director , was named director of the downtown Washington facility , which often does groundbreaking work but is just as often overlooked in the lineup of Washington museums .
3856090	Sterling said that the institution , which is celebrating its 20th year , has a strong foundation .
3856091	Her vision for it includes ensuring that the museum stands out from others in Washington and the world .
3856092	`` I want to go back to the core mission , with new strategies , new stories , new scholarships .
3856093	We also want a new civic identity , '' Sterling said .
3856094	`` Like any start-up , there were certain things we needed to do first -- building the board , creating the programs and deciding the character .
3856095	Now , with the 20th anniversary , we realized that we had arrived and could create the kind of buzz we wanted .
3856096	I want to put my emphasis on that . ''
3856097	She suggested that some old-fashioned marketing is the key .
3856098	`` We are very proud of our permanent collection .
3856099	We are this jewel box of a building with great work in it .
3856100	I want us to blow our horn louder , '' she said .
3856101	In January , the museum was one of 20 museums and libraries that received a medal from the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services for its commitment to public service .
3856102	Sterling joined the staff in 1988 , a year after the museum opened in its permanent venue , a landmark building at 13th Street and New York Avenue NW .
3856103	The institution , founded by Wilhelmina Cole Holladay , started with 500 works ; it now has almost 3,000 .
3856104	More than 800 artists are represented .
3856105	The museum drew record crowds to its shows on folk artist Grandma Moses in 2000 and theater and film director Julie Taymor in 2000 and 2001 .
3856106	Despite its successes , its yearly attendance averages about 140,000 .
3856107	Sterling , a Cleveland native , studied at Washington University in St. Louis and later received advanced degrees from Princeton University .
3856108	She wrote her doctoral dissertation on abstract painter Kenneth Noland .
3856109	During her tenure , the museum has had 10 directors , and Sterling has twice served as interim head .
3856110	She has been acting director since October , and part of her charge is to bring stability to the administration .
3856111	`` My vision is simple .
3856112	In 10 years , I want the Women 's Museum to be remembered as presenting a unique experience and education .
3856113	I want the visitor to say they are eager to visit , '' she said .
3856114	The museum has 50 full-time employees and an annual budget of $ 10.5 million .
3856115	As a curator , Sterling organized surveys of photographer Carrie Mae Weems and painters Sarah Charlesworth , Romaine Brooks and Alice Neel , as well as two rare retrospectives of Brazilian art .
3856116	In addition , as the curator of contemporary art , she brought more photography , abstract painting and feminist art into the archives .
3856117	She declined to reveal her favorite shows .
3856118	`` Like an artist , I believe the last work I have done is the best , '' Sterling said .
3856119	For its anniversary , the museum conducted an endowment campaign and collected pledges and gifts totaling $ 40 million .
3856120	`` Like a lot of museums out there , the challenge is finances , '' Sterling noted .
4276166	One of Appalachia 's coal-mining giants agreed Thursday to pay $ 20 million , the largest such fine imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency , after an investigation found more than 4,500 instances in which mine runoff tainted nearby waters .
4276167	Massey Energy Co. , based in Richmond , Va. , also pledged to make about $ 10 million worth of upgrades to prevent such violations and to clean up a West Virginia stream ravaged by mining-related pollution .
4276168	The terms were mandated in a consent decree filed Thursday in federal court in Charleston , W. Va.
4276169	The previous largest fine for violating federal Clean Water Act permits , designed to keep rivers and streams clean , was more than $ 12 million .
4276170	It was levied against Virginia 's Smithfield Foods in 1997 for contaminating waterways with hog waste .
4276171	The EPA sued Massey in May .
4276172	The agency said the penalty was triggered by the scale of Massey 's misconduct .
4276173	Robert Klepp , the lead EPA attorney in the case , said dirt , powdered coal and metals leaked out of dozens of Massey-owned sites and into waterways in West Virginia and Kentucky for almost seven years .
4276174	`` This is a signal that , you know , EPA is on the job , '' Klepp said .
4276175	A years-long investigation had shown that Massey neglected environmental safeguards , he said , adding : `` They had other priorities .
4276176	We think this agreement is going to refocus the priorities . ''
4276177	Massey is among the top 10 coal companies in the country , and it dominates in central Appalachia , a region that includes Virginia , Kentucky and southern West Virginia .
4276178	Roger Hendriksen , a spokesman for Massey , said that the company 's violations were generally minor and that there had been no serious damage to the environment as a result .
4276179	But , he said , Massey agreed to settle with the government because of the potential for an even more massive fine , which would have resulted had every violation earned the maximum punishment .
4276180	`` The perceived potential liability had become a concern for Massey shareholders , '' Hendriksen said .
4276181	Only a fraction of the company 's environmental tests showed problems , he said .
4276182	`` I suppose one could say that we have not been perfect , but we are , again , in compliance .
4276183	... 99 percent of the time , '' he added ,
4276184	Federal officials and environmentalists said the company 's violations had the potential to upset life in the creeks and rivers that run through hollows near the mines .
4276185	Klepp said that even simple dirt , in high amounts , could clog the gills of fish or bury tiny animals living on a creek bottom .
4276186	`` Everything you imagine in your mind , in terms of a mountain stream -- that vanishes '' in the worst cases , Klepp said .
4276187	In some cases , he said , tests showed that runoff from Massey mines contained 10 times as much dirt as it was supposed to .
4276188	`` You can imagine what water like that looks like coming out of the pipe , '' he said .
4276189	Many of the polluting sites were strip mines or `` mountaintop removal '' sites .
4276190	At the mountaintop mines , entire Appalachian peaks are sheared off to reach the seams of coal inside .
4276191	Rainwater can carry out loose earth and coal residue as it flows from the sites , and the mines can open pockets of underground water , which becomes polluted as it leaks out .
4276192	In many instances , federal officials said , Massey 's violations stemmed from an inability to corral this polluted water , which allowed it to wash into streams untreated .
4276193	The improvements mandated in the decree include a new system that will provide fast results of water testing so that problems can be spotted quickly .
4276194	The company will also have to pay to clean the Little Coal River , a stream in southwestern West Virginia that has been heavily affected by mine waste .
4276195	The $ 20 million fine will be paid into the U.S. Treasury 's general fund , Klepp said .
4276196	Environmentalists in West Virginia and Washington applauded the fine yesterday and noted other environmental damage caused by mountaintop-removal mines in that area .
4276197	`` We lose the fish , we bury the streams , '' said Cindy Rank of the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy .
4276198	`` It 's like putting the mountain through a Mixmaster , a blender kind of thing , and putting it back . ''
4394048	So it 's a windup and a pitch -- but are we talking about that guy on the mound with the hardball , or the folks in the stands unsnarling their yarn and embroidery thread and sharing their passion for handcrafting ?
4394049	And is that a designated hitter or a designated knitter ?
4394050	Actually , it 's both .
4394051	In New York on Aug. 8 , the New York Mets battle the Atlanta Braves and host their first Stitch N ' Pitch , aiming to draw fans of both baseball and needle crafts .
4394052	The first-ever Stitch N ' Pitch , reportedly the brainchild of a Seattle Mariners marketing exec , was played at Safeco Field in July 2005 .
4394053	It drew 1,600 fans right off the bat .
4394054	The National Needlearts Association , a business trade group , got involved last year , luring knitters , crocheters , needlepointers and embroiderers to a dozen Major League ballparks .
4394055	This year , says TNNA spokeswoman Libby Butler-Gluck in an e-mail , the idea has spread to 23 big-league teams .
4394056	Nimble-fingered fans will pay $ 15 a ticket at Shea , and get to meet and socialize with fellow crafters , as the whole group sits together in the ballpark .
4394057	The Mets ' plans are still being finalized , but at other Stitch N ' Pitch games , TNNA sets up tables and provides lessons so anyone can learn how to knit , crochet or do needlepoint .
4394058	Sometimes the ceremonial first pitch is thrown using a ball of yarn , and giveaways are part of the fun , with attendees getting a Stitch N ' Pitch tote bag `` stuffed '' with goodies , Butler-Gluck says .

4884801	The hype surrounding the astonishing rise to prominence of British rookie Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton was given a turbo-boost on Sunday when Bernie Ecclestone compared him to seven-times champion driver Michael Schumacher .
4884802	Ecclestone , the Formula One commercial ring-master who will be 77 later this year and who has a taste for controversy , said that if Hamilton , 22 , wore Schumacher 's helmet when racing during Grand Prix weekends , no-one would know it was not the famous German inside the car .
4884803	Since he made his debut in Melbourne this year at the season - opening Australian Grand Prix , Hamilton , the first man of Afro - Carribean descent to drive in Formula One , has caused a sensation .
4884804	In his first three races , he has finished on the podium in Australia , Malaysia and Bahrain and on Sunday he planned to go one better than that and record his first victory in the Spanish Grand Prix .
4884805	Ecclestone , a seasoned observer of the sport and a former team owner who has seen such talents as Brazilians Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna win races and titles , not to mention every other driver since the early-1970 's , believes Hamilton is not only a potential winner also , but a champion in the making .
4884806	He said : `` He is doing a super job .
4884807	If you looked at him and put Michael 's helmet on , then you would think it was Michael . ''
4884808	`` And , he will do whatever he has to do to win races , and if by any chance he happens to be a world champion because of that , then that is how it is .
4884809	It is a bonus . ''
4884810	Ecclestone added , with a grin : `` He is a nice guy , a really nice guy .
4884811	But I would n't want people to start talking about -LRB- the championship -RRB- because we do n't want to put him under that much pressure , do we ? ''
4884812	Even before he wins his maiden Grand Prix , Hamilton has received more praise than any other driver of similar experience in the sport 's history .
4884813	Born in Stevenage , a post-war new town in Hertfordshire , 45 kms north of London , Hamilton drew strength from a broken home - his parents separated when he was two years old - and formed a strong relationship with his father through which he forged his racing career .
4884814	But it has been the backing of McLaren team chief Ron Dennis that made the difference for Hamilton , helping him accelerate his life clear of his contemporaries in the suburbs of Stevenage through success in karting and , eventually , into the McLaren Mercedes - Benz race team .
4884815	Many in Formula One believe he has not only the talent , speed , intelligence and dedication to succeed at the very highest levels , but also the determination .
4884816	Yet he has managed to remain essentially level-headed through all of his success .
4884817	A first race victory , however , when it does arrive , will multiply the fame and attention he has received so far and land him in potential ` celebrity ' land along with most other top drivers .
4884818	And that is when the time will come for him to consider taking three-times world champion Jackie Stewart 's advice and leaving Hertfordshire - where his family have moved from working-class Stevenage to executive-commuter town Tewin - for a tax exile 's life in Monte Carlo .
5873876	Despite the global economic crisis and falling newspaper sales around the world , a new English-language daily is hitting the newsstands in Jakarta Wednesday with big ambitions of having a regional impact .
5873877	The Jakarta Globe is entering a market already saturated with Indonesian - language dailies and dominated for the past 25 years in English by The Jakarta Post .
5873878	But it has the backing of one of Indonesia 's richest men , billionaire tycoon James Riady , and a new editorial team of locals and expats that senior editor Lin Neumann believes can make the full-colour broadsheet a regional player .
5873879	`` We want to be compared to The South China Morning Post , The Straits Times and The Bangkok Post , as well as anything in the local market , '' he told AFP Tuesday on the eve of the launch .
5873880	`` We 're really trying to put out a paper that gains respect internationally and locally , '' said Neumann , former executive editor of The Hong Kong Standard .
5873881	Eleven months in the making from the time of the first planning meetings in December , The Jakarta Globe is set to be a 48-page daily with an emphasis on lifestyle and sports as well as local news .
5873882	Other executives have said it is aiming at a print run of around 50,000 copies , but Neumann would not be drawn on numbers .
5873883	Neumann said it had not been easy to start up a new newspaper in the midst of the worst global economic slump since the Great Depression , but he was confident Riady 's Lippo Group could ride out the storm .
5873884	`` It has n't caused any concern yet .
5873885	I hope this thing gets resolved and Indonesia is n't hurt too much by it , but it has n't changed our models .
5873886	The company thinks it 's in a good position to survive this , '' he said .
5873887	Setting up the newsroom and hiring the dozens of reporters , photographers and designers required to put together a quality broadsheet had been a `` huge task , '' he said .
5873888	`` We 've hired a whole newsroom full of people .
5873889	We 've built a newsroom from scratch .
5873890	The newsroom used to be a carpark , there was nothing here , '' he said .
5873891	`` It 's taken almost 11 months to get it started .
5873892	We never announced a launch date ... When we ran into problems we took a deep breath and said the most important thing is to get it right . ''
5873893	As for the competition , he said The Globe did not want a war with The Post .
5873894	The new paper will hit the stands at 8,500 rupiah -LRB- 79 cents -RRB- each , compared to The Post at 5,500 rupiah .
5873895	`` We believe there 's a market for two broadsheet dailies in Jakarta .
5873896	It 's a big city and I believe , and we hope , that The Jakarta Post agrees that competition is good for everybody , '' he said .
5873897	Questions have been raised about Riady 's intentions in starting the new paper , and what it means for The Globe 's editorial independence to be owned by a finance and banking group with interests across the Indonesian economy .
5873898	Riady was at the center of a scandal of political influence in the early 1990s when he was accused of illegally buying favors from US president Bill Clinton .
5873899	In 2001 he agreed to plead guilty to a campaign contribution offense and pay the US federal government fines worth 8.6 million dollars .
5873900	Neumann said he was convinced Riady `` wants to have a real newspaper '' and not a mouthpiece for his commercial and political interests .
5873901	`` We 've had discussions about editorial independence since the first meeting .
5873902	There 's absolutely no interference in this newspaper and none anticipated , '' he said .
6371257	Billionaire Russian businessman Boris Berezovsky will not face charges in Britain after allegedly calling for the use of violence to oust President Vladimir Putin , officials said Thursday .
6371258	The Crown Prosecution Service , which oversees prosecutions in England and Wales , said Berezovsky , living in exile in Britain , had not broken laws against calling for the violent overthrow of foreign states .
6371259	Susan Hemming , head of its counter-terrorism division , added : `` We concluded that he appeared to indicate civil disobedience as the model he was advocating .
6371260	`` This would fall far short of advocating terrorist violence . ''
6371261	The decision relates to an interview Berezovksy gave to The Guardian newspaper in April when the prominent Kremlin foe called for the use of `` force '' to oust the Russian president and agreed he was fomenting a revolution .
6371262	He later backtracked , saying that elections were `` not a viable means '' of securing change in Russia and that he did , therefore , support other methods .
6371263	`` However , I wish to make very clear that all of these methods would be bloodless , '' he added .
6371264	`` I do support direct action .
6371265	I do not advocate or support violence . ''
6371266	Russia called for Berezovsky 's extradition in the wake of the comments .
6372394	The United Nations weather agency remained mired in scandal on Wednesday , as a former auditor asked to address its annual congress over an alleged fraud scandal involving some 3.5 million dollars -LRB- 2.6 million euros -RRB- .
6372395	Maria Veiga , a former World Meteorological Organisation -LRB- WMO -RRB- internal auditor who claims she was fired after probing the scandal , alleged that the embezzled funds were partly linked to campaigns for elections of the agency 's secretary general in 2003 .
6372396	The amount is equivalent to about six percent of the agency 's budget .
6372397	`` The embezzlement of some 3.5 million dollars from WMO ... was for the purpose of influencing the outcome of election of the position of the WMO Secretary - General during the Congress in May 2003 , '' she told a press conference .
6372398	Veiga said she would welcome the opportunity to address the current WMO congress directly .
6372399	At a subsequent press briefing , WMO chairman Alexander Bedritsky said he was ready to meet Veiga .
6372400	The organization 's current secretary general , Michel Jarraud of France , ruled out however her addressing the congress directly .
6372401	Jarraud denies any wrongdoing or connection with the affair , adding he was not a candidate for secretary general at the time in question .
6372402	On Sunday it emerged that the regional prosecutor in Geneva , Daniel Zappelli , had opened another investigation into possible use of the embezzled funds to pay for travel by developing nation representatives and influence voting .
6372403	Swiss secretary of state Michael Ambuehl told the opening session of the WMO congress on Monday that reform was urgently needed to restore the organization 's credibility .
6372404	`` The embezzlement case uncovered a few weeks after the previous congress has caused serious damage .
6372405	`` To tackle natural catastrophes linked to global warming , we need a strong WMO that is entirely focused on its basic mission , '' he said .

7184151	Israeli troops raided several warehouses belonging to a Hamas - linked charity in the flashpoint West Bank town of Hebron overnight , witnesses said on Tursday .
7184152	The soldiers arrived at the warehouses belonging to the Islamic Charity Movement late Wednesday and filled five trucks with food aid and other goods , they said .
7184153	The Israeli army could not immediately comment on the incident .
7184154	The raids came a week after Israel shut down several offices in and around Hebron belonging to the Islamic Charity Movement and the Islamic Youth Association , charging that they were being used to finance terrorism .

7228245	The Paris Opera has canceled two shows planned for Friday night , including the world premiere of a ballet by the Briton Wayne McGregor , due to a wildcat a strike over pension reform .
7228246	The Palais Garnier Opera said a walkout by part of its technical staff forced it to cancel the evening 's performance of McGregor 's `` Genus '' , as well as `` Medea 's Dream '' by the French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj .
7228247	The modern Opera Bastille in the east of the city was also forced to cancel a performance of Giacomo Puccini 's `` Tosca '' .
7228248	Staff at the state-owned Paris Opera and Comedie Francaise joined in a strike last week over plans by President Nicolas Sarkozy 's government to reform the special pension benefits of 500,000 public sector workers .
7228249	The 1,680 permanent staff of the Opera have one of the oldest pension systems in France , created in 1698 by Louis XIV for the Opera 's predecessor the Royal Academy of Music .
7228250	The most spectacular measure concerns the 154 dancers of the Opera ballet , who can retire at 40 -- and must do by 42 -- after 10 years in service .
7228251	The 102 members of the Opera choir can retire aged 50 .
7228252	The pension system is designed to reflect the physical strains of Opera work , but also allow a healthy turnover among its artists .
7228253	Currently the state bails out the Paris Opera pension fund to the tune of 10 million euros -LRB- 14.3 million dollars -RRB- each year because contributions from workers fall short of payments .
7228254	Overall , the French special pensions fund costs taxpayers five billion euros a year .
7355600	Hollywood star Jennifer Aniston of `` Friends '' fame has found a new flame , British model Paul Sculfor , People magazine reports .
7355601	Aniston , 38 , met Sculfor , 36 , through friends at a restaurant and began sharing free time and their passion for Mexican food , the magazine reports .
7355602	Aniston , who divorced Brad Pitt after five years of marriage , in October 2005 , later dated fellow Hollywood actor and funnyman Vince Vaughan .
7355603	Sculfor , a would-be actor known in his country for an underwater Levis jeans commerical , is sports-oriented and courtly , People quotes a friend of his as saying .
7768442	Polluters releasing more than their share of the so-called greenhouse gases responsible for global warming would be slapped with fines under a plan unveiled Friday by opposition Liberals .
7768443	The plan -- which could come into effect under a Liberal government from January 2008 if the party is returned to power -- would charge companies 20 Canadian dollars -LRB- 17 US -RRB- per tonne of carbon dioxide released in excess of the company 's `` carbon budget '' and jump to 30 dollars -LRB- 25 US -RRB- in 2011 .
7768444	`` We can not keep using our atmosphere as a dump , '' Liberal boss Stephane Dion , as he presented the `` pay as you pollute '' plan .
7768445	Companies staying below their quotas could reap rewards by selling their rights to pollute .
7768446	If Liberals are able to implement their plan , they would assign each company its carbon budget , a portion of Canada 's commitment to meet the Kyoto Protocol target of six percent below 1990 emissions levels .
7768447	The Liberal plan targets the largest polluters , especially power generation and the oil and gas industries , such as extractors of oil from Canada 's vast deposits of oil sands , which require energy to separate the crude .
7768448	Liberals argued it would not be a tax .
7768449	`` This is the strongest proposal for regulating industrial greenhouse gas pollution made by any political party in Canada , '' said the Pembina Institute in a statement .
7768450	`` It sets a new standard against which the -LRB- Conservative Stephen -RRB- Harper government 's soon-to-be-announced regulatory framework must be judged , '' said Matthew Bramley of Pembina , a Canadian environmental think tank .
7768451	The Conservative Harper government has said repeatedly that Canada is not up to meeting the Kyoto commitments , but announced early this year financing for environmental projects .
7768452	Dion said just 700 companies emitted 50 percent of Canada 's greenhouse gases .
7768453	As an incentive to innovate , companies could recover as much as half of their fines to invest in their own projects to lower emissions .
7768454	A layer of gases in Earth 's upper atmosphere allows rays of sunlight in but does not let heat out , as does the glass in a greenhouse .
7768455	While the effect is necessary for life here , the release of carbon and other gases into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution has caused a steady rise in Earth 's temperature , which scientists fear could upset weather , sea levels and biological balances .
8166882	Pop star Madonna wants to adopt another Malawian child , a girl called Grace , despite a storm of controversy over her efforts to adopt a Malawian boy last year , a report said Friday .
8166883	Citing unnamed sources , the Sun tabloid in London said Madonna was intent on adopting three-year-old girl Grace after watching a documentary about a child care home for orphans in the African country .
8166884	`` Madonna saw a film of children at a place called The Consol Home , '' The Sun quoted an unidentified source said to be close to the star as saying .
8166885	`` She spotted a beautiful girl called Grace who lit the room with her smile , and fell head over heels for her .
8166886	Madonna kept saying , ` That girl has so much love in her .
8166887	I want to help her achieve her potential ' , '' the source said .
8166888	`` But adoption officials are being very strict after uproar when Madonna adopted David .
8166889	They know Grace is her first choice , but have insisted she looks at other girls first -- and that the final decision is theirs . ''
8166890	The granting of an 18-month interim custody order , which enabled Madonna to take young David Banda out of Malawi last year , sparked heated debate about adoption laws in a country where the number of orphans is surging as a result of AIDS .
8166891	A legal challenge is now underway from rights groups who claim that existing legislation in Malawi does not allow for international adoption .
8166892	According to The Sun , Madonna will fly to Malawi on Sunday with her three children , including David , though her husband Guy Ritchie will not join them .
8166893	`` It was always Madonna 's intention to adopt two orphans from Malawi -- a boy and a girl .
8166894	Grace is healthy , stunning , and has no living relatives .
8166895	It was the fact David 's dad Yohane was alive and well that caused most of the problems last time , '' the source told The Sun .
8166896	David 's father , Yohane Banda , was initially quoted as saying he did not realize his son would be taken out of the country for good , but later said he supported the adoption .
8421281	Arsene Wenger has reiterated his belief that he could never manage England because international teams should have a coach from their own country .
8421282	Wenger has always been clear that he prefers club management although , with England coach Steve McClaren clinging to his job by a slender thread , the Arsenal boss has been promoted as an ideal candidate to replace him .
8421283	The Frenchman is adamant the English Football Assocation should look to their own if McClaren is sacked .
8421284	`` I manage in England and I hope I can help English football but the national team should be managed by an English guy , '' Wenger said in an interview in Four Four Two magazine .
8421285	`` If I 'm England manager and I play France , what national anthem do I sing ? ''
8869681	The United States is prepared to send disaster relief assistance to Jamaica if it becomes necessary after the passage of powerful Hurricane Dean , the White House said Saturday .
8869682	The US package would include aid teams , relief supplies , water containers , medicine , generators , and disaster hygiene kits , national security spokesman Gordon Johndroe said as US President George W. Bush was on his Texas ranch .
8869683	The US ambassador there , Brenda LaGrange Johnson , has been working closely with Jamaican authorities on what to include in the aid package `` should it be necessary , '' Johndroe told reporters .
8869684	Top officials from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency -LRB- FEMA -RRB- have also been in touch with their counterparts in Mexico on possible US help there , but the situation in Jamaica is more urgent , he said .
8869685	`` If Mexico says they need some of our assistance , we 'll look at that .
8869686	Right now we know Jamaica needs our assistance , '' said the spokesman .
8869687	In a sign of concern at the massive storm , Bush was briefed twice Saturday on Dean and has approved a rare pre-landfall emergency declaration for the state of Texas , said Johndroe .
8869688	`` This allows the federal government to move in people , equipment and supplies now , '' he explained .
8869689	FEMA officials are working closely with Texas officials , including Governor Rick Perry , `` in particular to address the special needs populations along the southern Texas border '' expected to bear the storm 's brunt , he said .
8869690	That could mean federal aid to help the elderly , people needing transportation should local authorities recommend or require an evacuation , and people with special medical needs , said Johndroe .
9061833	The president of Japanese camera maker Pentax Corp. will resign to take responsibility for an internal conflict over a planned merger with optical glass maker Hoya Corp. , news reports said Monday .
9061834	Pentax president Fumio Urano , 63 , will step down by the end of May and board member Takashi Watanuki , 54 , is expected to replace him under a reshuffle to be approved on Tuesday , Kyodo News reported , quoting unnamed sources .
9061835	A company spokesman confirmed that a board meeting will take place on Tuesday , adding : `` A top management reshuffle may be on the agenda at the meeting . ''
9061836	The reported rift among board members comes after Hoya said Friday it was considering launching a tender offer for Pentax instead of a merger through a share swap .
9061837	The two companies agreed last December to merge their operations through a share swap that would take effect from October 2007 , but Hoya said in a statement that it may offer to buy Pentax shares instead .
9061838	Hoya has reportedly proposed a new merger plan under which it will raise its proposed offer for Pentax by about 20 percent to 770 yen per share to secure the support of shareholders .
9061839	The two companies , which are both manufacturers of medical equipment , had said in December they planned to sign a contract in April and integrate into Hoya Pentax HD Corp as of October 1 .
9061840	Urano took the initiative to push for the merger with Hoya , but some directors at Pentax are reportedly unhappy with the merger plan .
9144089	If the Oscars are a celebration of liberal America , then Ellen DeGeneres was a logical choice as host for Hollywood 's biggest night of the year .
9144090	The pioneering gay comic made headlines around the world in 1997 when she came out on national television in a two-part interview with Diane Sawyer before doing the same again on her hit television sitcom `` Ellen . ''
9144091	But it is DeGeneres 's quick-fire wit and sparkling one-liners that have endeared her to the millions of fans who watch her daytime show -- and made her a natural for the role of Oscars host .
9144092	`` Ellen DeGeneres was born to host the Academy Awards , '' said Oscars show producer Laura Ziskin , describing the hosting duties as the most challenging job in showbusiness .
9144093	`` It requires someone who can keep the show alive and fresh and moving , as well as someone who is a flat-out great entertainer , '' Ziskin said .
9144094	`` Ellen completely fits the bill . ''
9144095	DeGeneres , 49 , has said hosting the Oscars will be the fulfillment of a lifelong ambition .
9144096	`` There 's two things I 've always wanted to do in my life .
9144097	One is to host the Oscars .
9144098	The second is to get a call from Laura Ziskin , '' she said .
9144099	DeGeneres has proved her talent on the awards show circuit before , most notably when hosting the Emmys that followed the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington .
9144100	She won praise from the critics for striking just the right tone for the occasion -- and providing a memorable one-liner in the process .
9144101	`` We 're told to go on living our lives as usual , because to do otherwise is to let the terrorists win , and really , what would upset the Taliban more than a gay woman wearing a suit in front of a room full of Jews ? ''
9144102	she said .
9144103	Prior to the launch of DeGeneres 's chat show , she had provided the voice for the character Dory in hit animated movie `` Finding Nemo '' and also criss-crossed the United States on a 35-city stand-up comedy tour .
9144104	Born in Louisiana in 1958 , DeGeneres began her career as a stand - up comic in New Orleans before graduating to television in the early 1980s , where she was soon appearing regularly on late-night shows .
9144105	She received a stamp of approval from the legendary Johnny Carson , and after stints on `` Open House '' and `` Laurie Hill , '' she was given her own sitcom , `` Ellen , '' which ran until 1998 .
9144106	A follow-up series was canceled after one season in 2001 , but she returned with `` The Ellen DeGeneres Show '' in 2003 , which won 15 Emmy Awards in its first three seasons on the air .
9196119	The Paris Opera and National Library are to put on display two urns next week containing recordings buried a century ago to preserve the leading voices of the era for posterity , they announced .
9196120	On December 24 1907 24 records were sealed in two urns during a solemn ceremony in the basement of the Palais Garnier opera house in central Paris .
9196121	Each urn contained 12 discs representative of the best of French and Italian opera from Bizet and Gounod to Donizetti , Rossini and Verdi as interpreted by the leading artistes of the day -- including the legendary diva Dame Nellie Melba and the Italian lyric tenor Enrico Caruso .
9196122	The records were donated by the head of the Gramophone Company in France , Alfred Clark , who stipulated that they should not be opened for 100 years `` so men of that epoch can hear what the leading voices of our time sounded like . ''
9196123	The urns were exhumed in 1989 and handed to the library for safekeeping .
9196124	They will be shown to the public at a formal ceremony on Wednesday but not opened because of the potential danger from the bands of asbestos used at the time to protect the records .
9196125	The recordings will be extracted from their protective covering under secure conditions during the course of 2008 , the two institutions said .
9196126	EMI , heir of the Gramophone Company , will bring out a CD from the contents of the urns and another ceremony on the lines of the one in 1907 will be organised `` to preserve recordings representative of contemporary music , '' they said .

10276365	The NFL has kept a steady number of black head coaches , while slightly increasing the ranks of Asian and Latino players , earning a B + in an annual diversity study on Wednesday .
10276366	However , the league did n't get a grade for gender diversity for the fourth year in a row .
10276367	The NFL is the only U.S. pro sports organization that refuses to share its league office data with University of Central Florida 's Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports , which also conducts annual studies on the NBA , Major League Baseball , WNBA , and Major League Soccer .
10276368	The last time the NFL shared its data , for the 2004 study , it received a D + for gender hiring practices .
10276369	`` We prefer to focus on our own initiatives to enhance diversity and inclusiveness in our workplace , '' NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said .
10276370	Richard Lapchick , report author and head of UCF 's diversity institute in Orlando , Fla. , said the league data would probably be better than the NFL 's most recent grade .
10276371	At the team level , 18 percent of senior administrators were women for 2007 , along with 11 percent of vice presidents , according to the newest report .
10276372	Lapchick compiled that information from media guides for the NFL 's 32 teams .
10276373	He goes through the same process for other sports , then usually sends a compilation to the league for feedback and corroboration .
10276374	All but the NFL respond , he said .
10276375	However , Lapchick gives the NFL credit for its own improvement initiatives , like the Rooney Rule .
10276376	The change , approved in 2002 , requires teams to interview at least one minority candidate for each head coaching vacancy .
10276377	The NFL has six black head coaches and five black general managers entering this season , the same as 2007 .
10276378	There were two black coaches in 2001 , six in 2005 and seven in 2006 .
10276379	Four new head coaches , all white , were hired entering the 2008 season .
10276380	`` I do n't read anything into that , '' Lapchick said .
10276381	`` With all leagues on any given cycle , it can turn out that way or it can turn out that a disproportionate percentage were coaches of color that were hired . ''
10276382	In the 2007 season , 66 percent of NFL players were black , a one point decrease from the previous year .
10276383	White players continued to comprise 31 percent of the total , but the difference was made up by a small increase in Latino and Asian players .

10345892	A woman charged with running a prostitution ring in the U.S. capital city made good on her threat to identify high-profile clients , listing a military strategist known for his `` shock and awe '' combat theories as a regular customer in court documents .
10345893	Deborah Jeane Palfrey , who is acting as her own attorney , said Harlan K. Ullman , a senior associate with the Center for Strategic and International Studies , `` is only one of dozens of such officials '' who will be exposed as she prepares her defense .
10345894	Ullman declined to talk about the claim in a brief telephone interview with The Associated Press Thursday night , saying `` the allegations are beneath the dignity of a comment . ''
10345895	The 50-year-old Palfrey was indicted last month by a federal grand jury on charges of running a high-class call girl ring from her home in Vallejo , California .
10345896	She has denied the escort service engaged in prostitution .
10345897	In court records , prosecutors estimate that her business , Pamela Martin and Associates , generated more than $ 2 million -LRB- euro1 .5 million -RRB- in revenue over 13 years , with more than 130 women employed at various times to serve thousands of clients at $ 200 to $ 300 -LRB- euro150 to euro225 -RRB- a session .
10345898	Palfrey had threatened to sell phone records that would identify 10,000 clients to pay for her criminal defense , but a federal judge ordered her not to release them .
10345899	But Palfrey gave them to ABC News before the order took effect .
10345900	Since federal officials have seized her assets in a civil case involving the business , Palfrey argued in court papers Thursday for the judge to reconsider her request for $ 500,000 -LRB- euro371 ,000 -RRB- to hire an attorney to replace the public defender .
10345901	She contends that she needs a high-profile attorney because of the powerful forces that are lined up against her and her need to subpoena Ullman and others .
10345902	Palfrey hopes the customers will testify on her behalf that her escorts did not engage in prostitution .
10345903	Prosecutors have accused Palfrey of trying to intimidate potential witnesses by exposing them publicly .
10345904	Ullman 's lawyer , Mike Mukasey , also declined comment , saying the allegations do not deserve a response .
10345905	Ullman was the primary author of a 1996 report that coined the phrase `` shock and awe , '' which calls for a massive attack of precision air power that psychologically destroys an enemy 's will to fight as much as it destroys the physical ability to fight .
10345906	Palfrey said she has 46 pounds -LRB- 21 kilograms -RRB- of phone records that could expose thousands of clients .
10345907	Her civil attorney , Montgomery Blair Sibley , said he gave those records to ABC so it could assist in identifying clients who could testify on her behalf .
10345908	ABC said it plans to air a story on Palfrey on its prime-time news program `` 20\/20 '' next month .

10346014	One of the last independent steel unions in the U.S. formally merged with the United Steelworkers on Friday , adding to the ranks of North America 's largest industrial labor union .
10346015	Members of the Independent Steelworkers Union , which represents about 1,150 workers at Mittal Steel Co. 's mill in Weirton , West Virginia , voted overwhelmingly last month to join the Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania-based union .
10346016	`` We thought long and hard about the USW for a number of years , '' said ISU President Mark Glyptis .
10346017	`` We certainly believe that being a USW member ... is going to be in the best interest of our employees and our retirees , and it 's going to make the union movement stronger across this country . ''
10346018	Dave McCall , director of USW District 1 in Columbus , Ohio , said the agreement `` makes us a stronger , better union able to represent our members at all our facilities and in all our jurisdictions . ''
10346019	`` It 's about bargaining leverage , it 's about making sure our members get what they deserve for their sacrifices and their blood , sweat and tears , '' he told reporters and union representatives .
10346020	Members of the 56-year-old ISU have been told their dues will increase to 1.3 percent of their annual salaries plus 2 cents per working hour for an organizing fund .
10346021	But , proponents said , they will gain greater strength in organizing , bargaining and lobbying .
10346022	The USW is the largest industrial union in North America , with 850,000 members in the United States and Canada .
10346023	The union employs lobbyists in Washington , pension and benefits analysts , corporate researchers and collective bargaining teams .
10346024	Weirton workers also gain access to the Steelworkers ' $ 140 million -LRB- euro103 .46 million -RRB- strike fund , which gives workers on the picket line at least $ 100 -LRB- euro74 -RRB- .
10346025	The USW also represents most of the 3,100 workers at West Virginia 's other large producer , Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel , which has plants in Ohio , West Virginia and Pennsylvania .

11537502	BETHLEHEM , Pennsylvania 2007-02-28 20:44:17 UTC
11537503	A middle school principal was charged with dealing crystal methamphetamine after police found the drug in his school office .
11537504	John Acerra , 50 , of Allentown , Pennsylvania , was arrested Tuesday in his office at Nitschmann Middle School in Bethlehem , where police said they found meth on his desk .
11537505	There was no indication that Acerra sold the drug to students , but Acerra did allegedly sell the drug from his school office after hours and on weekends , said Dennis Mihalopoulos , an agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration .
11537506	Police said they began investigating Acerra in early February after an informant told them the principal was using and distributing the drug .
11537507	Acerra , who was in custody in lieu of bail , has an unlisted phone number and it was not clear if he had an attorney .
11537508	A letter was sent to parents informing them of Acerra 's arrest and teachers had spoken with the school 's 950 students , Bethlehem Area School District Superintendent Joseph Lewis told reporters Wednesday .
11537509	`` I am saddened and troubled by these events , '' Lewis said .
11537510	`` I offer no explanation .
11537511	There is none . ''
11537512	According to court documents , police last Thursday watched Acerra sell a small amount of meth to a customer in a store parking lot .
11537513	They stopped the buyer , who told officers he had been to Acerra 's home 10 to 15 times over the past three months , officials said .
11537514	Police then arranged for an informant to buy $ 200 -LRB- euro151 -RRB- worth of meth from Acerra on Saturday in the parking lot of an Allentown drug store , according to court documents .
11537515	On Tuesday , police set up another $ 200 -LRB- euro151 -RRB- deal with Acerra and the informant , who wore a listening device as he began conducting the transaction inside the principal 's office , authorities said .
11537516	Acerra did not have enough meth to sell to the informant , and he and the informant arranged to meet later that night to complete the buy , Mihalopoulos said Wednesday .
11537517	After the informant left the building , police entered Acerra 's office and found him sitting at his desk with a bag of meth next to a glass tube with meth residue and burn marks on it , according to court documents .
11537518	Also on the desk was the marked money the informant used to purchase the drug , the documents say .
12603428	CHICAGO 2008-11-19 06:44:43 UTC
12603429	Backers of a proposed high school touted as a haven for gay and bullied youth have pulled their proposal , saying they wanted to spend another year to finalize their plans .
12603430	Under mounting pressure from ministers and gay activists alike , Social Justice Solidarity High School planners had already changed the school 's name and focus to create a school that would be one of the nation 's largest to serve any students who have fallen victim to bullying and harassment .
12603431	The plan -- pulled Tuesday night , hours before a scheduled Wednesday vote on its creation -- also was a less explicitly gay version of a plan first presented to Chicago 's board of education in October by schools chief Arne Duncan .
12603432	The school 's intended start date remains fall 2010 , planners said .
12603433	`` The proposal has changed since the Oct. 8 public hearing , and the design team is taking an additional year to finalize the proposal , '' the design team said in a statement released Tuesday night by Chicago Public Schools .
12603434	Chad Weiden , who would be Solidarity High School 's principal , did not immediately return a telephone message from The Associated Press .
12603435	`` We respect the decision of the design team , and we look forward to them resubmitting their proposal in ' 09 , '' the district said in a statement .
12603436	The original plan was for the Social Justice High School : Pride Campus to open in 2010 and eventually serve 600 students , about half of whom were expected to identify as gay .
12603437	The newer Solidarity plan had the same timeline and enrollment goals , but a different mission .
12603438	The initial mission statement to serve `` the underserved population of Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender , and Questioning youth and their allies '' was replaced by one that offers protections for students regardless of `` orientation , '' but does n't mention sexuality .
12603439	Instead , the Solidarity school aimed to address `` citywide concerns over violence , bullying and harassment . ''
12603440	Students nationwide say sexual orientation and gender identity are two of the top three reasons behind bullying and harassment .
12603441	Appearance is No. 1 , according to the Gay , Lesbian and Straight Education Network .
12603442	A 2007 network survey of more than 6,200 middle and high school students found that 86 percent of gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered students experienced harassment in the past year because of their sexual orientation and 60 percent felt unsafe at school .
12603443	In the same survey , 33 percent reported skipping a day of school in the past month because they felt unsafe , compared to 4.5 percent of a national sample of secondary school students .
12603444	`` Harassment is the rule , not the exception , if you 're an LGBT student , '' said Kevin Jennings , founder of the New York City-based Gay , Lesbian and Straight Education Network .
12603445	Chicago 's school board had been slated to vote on the Pride Campus proposal in October , but the vote was delayed as school officials and organizers heard from ministers , gay activists and conservatives opposed to segregating gay students .
12603446	`` If we 're going to have a separate high school , let 's put the bullies in the high school , not the -LRB- gay -RRB- kids , '' said Rick Garcia , political director for the gay rights group Equality Illinois .
12603447	The Rev. Wilfredo De Jesus of New Life Covenant Church on Chicago 's West Side said ministers ' message to Chicago Public Schools was `` do n't segregate , tolerate . ''
12603448	`` The gay community has fought so long to be inclusive and now you 're going to isolate them , '' De Jesus said .
12603449	`` This is not sending the right message . ''
12603450	Other conservative critics argued that gay teens are n't the only ones being bullied and that taxpayer dollars should n't be used to provide a one-sided education on such a controversial topic .

14149313	Iran is using the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah as a `` proxy '' to arm Shiite militants in Iraq and that Tehran 's Quds force had prior knowledge of a January attack in Karbala in which five Americans died , a U.S. general said Monday .

14149315	Bergner said Dakdouk served for 24 years in Hezbollah and was `` working in Iraq as a surrogate for the Iranian Quds force . ''
14149316	The general also said that Dakdouk was a liaison between the Iranians and a breakaway Shiite group led by Qais al-Kazaali , a former spokesman for cleric Muqtada al-Sadr .
14149317	Bergner said al - Kazaali 's group carried out the January attack against a provincial government building in Karbala and that the Iranians assisted in preparations .

15082029	The Kansas City-based company said JBS , the world 's largest beef processor , will pay National Beef members about $ 465 million -LRB- euro306 million -RRB- in cash and $ 95 million -LRB- euro62 million -RRB- in JBS shares .
15082030	Under the deal , which still requires regulatory approval , JBS will assume an undisclosed amount of National Beef 's debt .
15082031	This is JBS ' second major U.S. purchase in the past year .
15082032	In July , the company acquired Greeley , Colorado-based Swift Foods Co. for $ 225 million -LRB- euro148 million -RRB- in cash .
15082033	Tim Klein , National Beef 's president , will become president and chief operating officer of the joint National Beef\/JBS-Swift beef operations , National Beef said in a news release .
15082034	`` Being able to diversify through JBS will put our company in a position to compete long term in an increasingly competitive environment , '' said Steve Hunt , chief executive officer of U.S. Premium Beef , the majority owner of National Beef .
15082035	`` Our producer owners and other producers who market cattle through USPB will now have a more geographically diversified company with multiple locations to deliver the high-quality cattle they produce for our value-added programs . ''

15658294	The trustee of the former Weirton Steel Corp. is suing Zurich Specialties London Ltd. , claiming the insurance company refused to pay a legitimate claim and now owes the bankrupt steelmaker 's creditors $ 39 million -LRB- euro27 .5 million -RRB- .
15658295	The complaint , filed in U.S. District Court in Wheeling , accuses Zurich of breach of contract on a policy that covered Weirton following its May 2003 Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing .
15658296	Lawyers for Weirton 's liquidating trust say the steelmaker incurred unforeseen losses after an August 2003 fire at West Virginia 's Pinnacle Mine halted the delivery of coke .
15658297	The mine , owned by U.S. Steel Corp. of Pittsburgh , supplied about 80 percent of the coke Weirton needed to produce raw steel .
15658298	Koppers Inc. supplied the other 20 percent , but it told Weirton that it would not continue that supply beyond Dec. 31 , 2003 .
15658299	The company filed a claim with Zurich in February 2004 , detailing losses more extensively that November , but it was never paid .
15658300	Though Weirton Steel says its losses exceeded $ 44 million , the company had a $ 5 million deductible , so the claim is for a lesser amount .
15658301	The bankruptcy settlement approved by a judge in 2004 provided only $ 30 million to Weirton Steel 's creditors , which include a trust set up to benefit employees .
15658302	If the trustee were to win the lawsuit or reach a financial settlement with Zurich , the creditors would share the proceeds .
15658303	Zurich declined comment on the lawsuit , which demands a jury trial and legal fees .
15658304	No court dates have been set .
15658305	A year after the Chapter 11 filing , Weirton Steel was sold for $ 237.5 million to Ohio-based International Steel Group , which six months later sold the operation to Mittal Steel USA .
15658306	Netherlands-based Mittal Steel Co. .
15658307	NV is now merging with Belgium 's Arcelor SA to create ArcelorMittal , the world 's largest steel company by sales .
15658308	No raw steel has been produced in Weirton since 2005 , and the mills that once employed 13,000 people now employ roughly 1,200 .
15658309	That number may soon drop .
15658310	In August , Mittal officials told United Steelworkers Local No. 2911 that the hot mill is not in the company 's 2008 business plan and will be shut down at the end of December .
15658311	The number of affected workers still has not been determined , President Mark Glyptis said Thursday .
15658312	The union is still hoping to avoid the shutdown .

17064090	Media rights groups on Monday called for an investigation into whether a Mexican jounalist gunned down over the weekend was killed because of his reporting .
17064091	Gerardo Garcia , a 24-year-old reporter for the daily La Opinion in the western state of Michoacan , was chased and shot to death Saturday at a hotel where he lived with his family , said Magdalena Guzman , a spokeswoman for Michoacan state prosecutors .

17073036	PORTLAND , Maine 2007-12-11 00:07:04 UTC
17073037	The drooping value of the U.S. dollar means Canadian Christmas tree growers are seeing less green this season .
17073038	Canadian Christmas tree growers have seen their U.S. sales decline in recent years because of increasing costs and competition from U.S. growers .
17073039	But it 's their own currency that 's causing them the most grief these days .
17073040	Compared to the U.S. greenback , the Canadian dollar is 15 percent higher in value than it was at the beginning of the year .
17073041	Because growers are paid in U.S. dollars , their revenues are dropping by the same amount .
17073042	Canadian exporters of products ranging from seafood , lumber and auto parts to Canadian Club whiskey are all in the same boat .
17073043	But Christmas trees are an especially visible example at this time of year .
17073044	The situation is blamed for driving Canada 's largest Christmas tree grower , Nova Scotia 's Kirk Forest Products , out of business .
17073045	`` That put the dagger to the heart , '' said the company 's founder , Rick Kirk , who is shipping about 250,000 trees , most of them to the U.S. , in his company 's final holiday season .
17073046	`` We know that the market is going to be squeezed year after year . ''
17073047	More than half of Canada 's Christmas trees are shipped to the U.S. , but the figure has dropped by about 20 percent , to about 2 million trees , since 2002 .
17073048	During that period , the value of the Canadian dollar grew by about 50 percent .
17073049	The effect on U.S. consumers is minimal because Canadian trees account for less than 10 percent of the total number of trees sold .
17073050	This season , the average purchase price for a live Christmas tree in the U.S. is expected to be similar to last year 's average of $ 40.50 -LRB- euro27 .65 -RRB- , said Rick Dungey of the National Christmas Tree Association in Chesterfield , Missouri .
17073051	While the exchange rate is bad for Canadian exporters , it is a boon for U.S. retailers because Canadians are flocking across the border this month to shop .
17073052	All probably thought they had seen the peak last summer when the Canadian dollar -- called the loonie -- reached a 28-year high against the greenback .
17073053	But the loonie 's value has continued to grow , reaching levels not seen since the U.S. Civil War 140 years ago , said Michael Woolfolk , senior currency strategist with the Bank of New York Mellon Corp. in New York .
17073054	The Canadian dollar surged to an all - time high of $ 1.10 against the greenback in November , a gain of 28 percent from Jan. 1 , before falling back a bit .
17073055	In dollars and cents , a Canadian grower who receives US$ 20 -LRB- euro13 .65 -RRB- for a tree would have pocketed $ 23.30 Canadian last December .
17073056	This month , the same US$ 20 per tree translates to about $ 20.20 Canadian , a drop of about $ 3 .
17073057	`` It erases our profits , or very close , '' said Larry Downey of Cookshire-Eaton , Quebec , president of the Canadian Christmas Tree Association .
17073058	The problems for Canadian Christmas tree growers began in 2002 , about the same time the Canadian dollar began rising in value .
17073059	Since then , Canadian tree exports to the U.S. have declined about 20 percent to 2.1 million trees last year .
17073060	Some Canadian growers have protected themselves to some degree by entering into futures contracts that are based on currency .
17073061	For the rest , the only other choices are to ride it out and hope for better times or get out .
17073062	Though Kirk is getting out , many Canadian growers are staying in hopes of negotiating better contracts next year , said Tom Ernst , another Christmas tree grower in Mahone Bay , Nova Scotia .
17073063	Ernst exports only 30 percent of his trees , so he 's hurt less than others who sell a greater percentage of their trees abroad .
17073064	`` We are n't putting all of our eggs in one basket , '' he said .
17073065	`` That was part of the idea behind it . ''
17073066	Higgins Family Christmas Trees also is sticking it out even though the company -- also in Nova Scotia -- exports all of its trees .
17073067	Forrest Higgins said the company plans to ship about 30,000 trees this season to Maine and down the East Coast .
17073068	`` We 've been in business a long time and you have to accept that there are real strong years when there 's a lot of money to be made , '' Higgins said .
17073069	`` You take those years when it 's profitable in stride with those years when it 's tough . ''
17073070	Based on this season , however , Canadian growers can expect spirited competition when they start negotiating for Christmas 2008 .
17073071	Phil Roberts , owner of Broadway Gardens in South Portland , Maine , said he may have to switch to locally grown trees , even if some Canadian suppliers have an edge on quality .
17073072	His tree prices are going up and he ca n't pass on all the increases to this customers .
17073073	Roberts is already paying $ 3 -LRB- euro2 .05 -RRB- to $ 4 -LRB- euro2 .73 -RRB- more per tree from Quebec Province than last season .
17073074	That 's because growers raised their prices over the summer in anticipation of the strong loonie .
17073075	`` They 're at a point where they 're higher than the Maine trees , '' Roberts said .
17073076	`` I 'll definitely be looking at Maine trees next year . ''

17467607	Shares in AK Steel Holding Corp. soared Tuesday after a report that ArcelorMittal , the world 's largest steelmaker , was considering a takeover bid .
17467608	ArcelorMittal spokesman Luc Scheer said the company had no comment on the report on a Financial Times Web site , which said the company may make a $ 40 -LRB- euro29 .50 -RRB- a share bid for AK Steel , valuing it at $ 4.5 billion -LRB- euro3 .32 billion -RRB- .
17467609	Shares of AK steel rose $ 3.60 -LRB- euro2 .66 -RRB- , or 11.2 percent , to $ 35.66 -LRB- euro26 .30 -RRB- in late morning trading Tuesday .
17467610	The stock has been as low as $ 11.11 in the past year .
17467611	`` We do n't have any comment , '' AK spokesman Alan McCoy said .
17467612	Jim Tyler , spokesman for the Machinists union members at the company 's largest mill in Middletown , near Cincinnati , said the union had no comment .
17467613	AK Steel Chief Executive James Wainscott has repeatedly said during conference calls with analysts about earnings reports that AK wants to stay independent .
17467614	Shares in ArcelorMittal fell $ 1.04 -LRB- euro .77 -RRB- , or 1.8 percent , to $ 56.44 -LRB- euro41 .63 -RRB- .
17467615	Union workers at AK Steel 's Middletown Works recently agreed on a new contract after a nearly 13-month lockout .
17467616	Some analysts had speculated that AK would become a takeover target once it shed some of its legacy costs and had a long-term labor agreement in place .
17467617	Such an acquisition would follow other recent consolidation in the steel industry , which includes Mittal Steel 's much larger hostile bid for Arcelor and then Tata Steel Ltd. 's purchase of Corus .
17467618	Arcelor SA , based in Luxembourg , and Mittal Steel Co. .
17467619	NV , based in Rotterdam , Netherlands , said last week they had moved on the first legal step of forming their combined company to be known as ArcelorMittal .
17467620	After the estimated $ 41 billion -LRB- euro30 .24 billion -RRB- deal , the company will control around 10 percent of global steel production .
17467621	Mittal Steel already has a strong presence in the Ohio area .
17467622	It bought Cleveland-based International Steel Group in 2005 in a deal that included plants in Ohio and Weirton Steel in Weirton , West Virginia , across the Ohio River from Steubenville .
17467623	AK Steel makes flat-rolled carbon steel and stainless and electrical steel used in cars and appliances .
17467624	Besides Middletown , AK Steel has smaller plants in Zanesville , Mansfield and Coshocton , Ohio ; Ashland , Kentucky ; Rockport , Indiana ; and Butler , Pennsylvania .

17556818	HARRISBURG , Pennsylvania 2007-09-10 20:16:43 UTC
17556819	The Pennsylvania Supreme Court wants to suspend the law license of I. Lewis `` Scooter '' Libby Jr. , the former White House aide convicted in March of lying and obstructing justice in a probe into the leak of a CIA operative 's identity .
17556820	The court directed Libby , a former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney , to show why his license should not be temporarily suspended in the wake of his federal convictions .
17556821	The order was posted on the court 's Web site Monday .
17556822	President George W. Bush commuted Libby 's 30-month jail sentence in July .
17556823	Libby paid a $ 250,000 -LRB- euro181 ,225 -RRB- fine and must serve two years of probation .
17556824	The former operative said the White House was trying to discredit her husband , a critic of Bush 's Iraq policy .
17556825	Court system records show Libby was licensed to practice law in Pennsylvania in 1976 , and that his license is currently on inactive status .
17556826	The records list his current address as the Washington suburb of McLean , Virgnia .
17556827	Caroline M. Brobeil , a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia law firm Schnader Harrison Segal and Lewis LLP , said Libby became an associate following his 1975 graduation from Columbia University Law School and left in 1981 .
17556828	Libby also was managing partner of the Washington , D.C. , office of the Philadelphia-based firm Dechert LLP from 1995 to 2001 .
17556829	Libby , 57 , a Connecticut native , attended Yale University as an undergraduate .
17556830	His law license was suspended by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in April .
17556831	The following month , the Board on Professional Responsibility recommended that the D.C. Court of Appeals disbar Libby if his conviction is sustained on appeal .
17556832	Jim Brochin , an attorney who represents Libby , declined to comment Monday .

18285351	Manitowoc Co. .
18285352	Inc. said Monday it has raised its bid for British food equipment supplier Enodis PLC , trumping the offer by Illinois Tool Works .
18285353	Manitowoc , based in Manitowoc , Wisconsin , raised its offer to 296 pence -LRB- US$ 5.79 ; euro3 .72 -RRB- per share , valuing Enodis at 1.08 billion pounds -LRB- US$ 2.1 billion ; euro1 .36 billion -RRB- .
18285354	The offer consists of 294 pence in cash and a dividend payment of two pence per share .
18285355	Enodis shares rose 2 percent to 304 pence -LRB- US$ 5.95 ; euro3 .82 -RRB- in early trading on the London Stock Exchange .
18285356	Manitowoc had opened the bidding for Enodis on April 14 at 260 pence -LRB- US$ 5.09 ; euro3 .27 -RRB- per share , but Illinois Tool Works Inc. , based in Glenview , Illinois , offered 282 pence -LRB- US$ 5.52 ; euro3 .55 -RRB- per share May 8 .
18285357	Last week , Enodis reported a profit of 9.7 million pounds -LRB- US$ 19 million ; euro12 .2 million -RRB- for the six months ending March 29 , compared with 17.3 million pounds in the comparable period a year ago .
18285358	The company attributed the drop in profit to the cost of restructuring .

18299753	LONDON 2008-05-19 11:48:10 UTC
18299754	The bidding war for British cooking equipment supplier Enodis PLC heated up on Monday , as Manitowoc Co. .
18299755	Inc. came back with a second offer to trump an approach by fellow U.S. company Illinois Tool Works .
18299756	Manitowoc , based in the Wisconsin town of the same name , raised its offer to 296 pence -LRB- US$ 5.79 ; euro3 .72 -RRB- per share , valuing Enodis at 1.08 billion pounds -LRB- US$ 2.1 billion ; euro1 .36 billion -RRB- .
18299757	Shares in the company , which supplies fryer systems to restaurants and retailers , including McDonald 's Corp. and Wal - Mart Stores Inc. , traded above that level on Monday -- up 2.4 percent at 305.25 pence -LRB- US$ 5.97 ; euro3 .85 -RRB- -- as the market priced in expectations of a higher bid .
18299758	Manitowoc , the biggest ice machine maker in the United States , opened up bidding on Enodis in April when it made an offer of 260 pence -LRB- US$ 5.09 ; euro3 .28 -RRB- per share , which was accepted by the British company .
18299759	However , Enodis changed allegiance when Illinois Tool Works , a Glenview , Ill.-based manufacturer of engineered products with more than 800 business units in 49 countries , made a sweetened 282 pence -LRB- US$ bid earlier this month .
18299760	Both of the suitors are including a 2 pence -LRB- 4 U.S. cents ; 3 euro cents -RRB- a share dividend as part of their bids .
18299761	Manitowoc said its offer was a 107.8 premium on Enodis ' share price on April 8 , the day before it made its first approach and called on Enodis to recommend its new offer .
18299762	Illinois Tool Works said it noted the increased offer and was `` considering its position with respect to Enodis and will make an announcement in due course . ''
18299763	Enodis had no immediate comment .
18299764	An Enodis-Manitowoc tie-up would give Manitowoc entry into two major new market segments -- hot food service and food retail equipment .
18299765	While a successful purchase by Illinois Tool would nearly double that U.S. company 's food equipment business and make the combined food equipment business nearly a fifth of its total revenues .
18299766	Enodis , which has a range of food-service products includes cooking equipment , refrigeration units , and ice and beverage dispensing equipment that are used in fast-food restaurants , institutions , grocery stores and supermarkets , has successfully fought off a series of takeover bids over the past two years .
18299767	The company , which has manufacturing facilities in North America , Europe and Asia , and employs 6,800 workers , last week reported a profit of 9.7 million pounds -LRB- US$ 19 million ; euro12 .2 million -RRB- for the six months ending March 29 , compared with 17.3 million pounds in the comparable period a year ago .
18299768	It attributed the drop in profit to the cost of restructuring .

21072385	BOSTON - What kind of a name is `` Mitt '' anyway ?
21072386	The former Massachusetts governor who has risen to the early top tier of Republican presidential hopefuls was named for his father 's first cousin Milton `` Mitt '' Romney , who played quarterback for the Chicago Bears in the 1920s .
21072387	The unusual name symbolizes how breeding , connections and sports have helped the second Mitt Romney surpass frontrunners Sen. John McCain of Arizona and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani in campaign fundraising for their party 's nomination .
21072388	And Romney leads these better known rivals in some public opinion polls in Iowa and New Hampshire , where the first votes will be cast in the presidential selection process , if not in GOP national preference surveys .
21072389	`` We 're well ahead of where we expected to be at this time , '' Romney said this week at his campaign headquarters in the city 's historic North End .
21072390	The candidate 's father , of course , was George Romney , former Republican governor of Michigan and an early presidential aspirant himself in the 1968 GOP campaign .
21072391	Mitt Romney 's first name is Willard , in honor of J. Willard Marriott , hotel magnate and best friend of the elder Romney .
21072392	Both the Romneys and Marriotts were devout Mormons .
21072393	When the 2008 Romney campaign signed up more than 24,000 new supporters in 24 hours this week , the candidate made a mass e-mailing to his classmates at the exclusive Cranbrook prep school in suburban Detroit .
21072394	`` There is some irony there , '' said Romney , whose personal fortune is now estimated at about $ 200 million .
21072395	`` I was the class cut-up . ''
21072396	And sports revived Romney 's political career after his first run at elective office ended with a defeat to incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy in the 1994 senate race in Massachusetts .
21072397	The turnabout came when Romney was recruited in 1999 to take over the scandal - plagued Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City .
21072398	There was some irony there , too , pointed out Tagg Romney , 37 , the oldest of the candidate 's five sons and an executive with the Los Angeles Dodgers .
21072399	After the Olympic selection , Tagg called in congratulations but teased that the sons -- knowing their dad 's modest athletic abilities -- could not have conceived of circumstances that would have led to him being pictured on the front page of the sports section .
21072400	The 2002 Games were threatened by debt , corruption and construction delays .
21072401	`` People across America had lost faith in the Olympics spirit , '' recalled Craig Romney , 26 , the youngest son .
21072402	One way his father rejuvenated interest was by training in the skeleton -- which is like the luge except the rider goes down the icy chute face first at about 80 mph .
21072403	`` It 's one of the craziest sports in the world , '' said Craig , a music producer for an ad agency in New York City .
21072404	`` And my dad is not exactly a thrill seeker . ''
21072405	Romney survived a televised skeleton run and the Olympics were a financial and athletic success .
21072406	The resulting praise and publicity helped propel his 2002 election to governor of Massachusetts .
21072407	`` The state faced a fiscal crisis when he came to office '' with a projected budget shortfall of more than $ 2 billion , said Michael Widmar , president of the non-partisan Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation .
21072408	`` The -LRB- Republican Romney -RRB- administration and the legislature , which was and is overwhelmingly Democratic , did a responsible job of closing this large budget gap . ''
21072409	But it took painful cuts in government programs and higher revenues to bring about a balanced budget , he said .
21072410	`` When the former governor says he did n't raise taxes , it 's true he did n't raise broad-based income taxes and sales taxes , '' said Widmar .
21072411	`` But they did raise new revenues through higher fees and new corporate taxes .
21072412	There was no other way to do it . ''
21072413	`` I see no distinction between a tax and a fee and he raised just about every fee that the state charges .
21072414	It was all done so he could say he balanced the budget without raising taxes , '' said Ron Vining , co-founder of Massachusetts Republicans for Truth .
21072415	`` And working families bore the burden '' of $ 260 million in increased fees on everything from car inspections to bus and subway fares to hunting and fishing licenses , he said .
21072416	`` And he did raise the gas tax two cents a gallon so he ca n't really say he did n't raise taxes , '' said Vining , who worked in Romney 's unsuccessful senate campaign against Kennedy .
21072417	Ann Romney was about 8 years old when she first encountered her future husband , who was 10 .
21072418	`` He threw rocks at my horse , '' she recalled at the campaign headquarters .
21072419	Both lived in affluent suburbs outside Detroit .
21072420	Before entering politics , George Romney had taken over American Motors , then lagging far behind the Big Three automakers of General Motors , Ford and Chrysler , and made Ramblers the first compact cars in the era of big fins .
21072421	On the campaign trail now , Mitt Romney tells audiences that his sons gave him a restored 1962 Rambler American for his recent 60th birthday .
21072422	In the 1960s , when the rock thrower and equestrian met again , he was the son of the governor .
21072423	`` We really noticed each other at a high school party when I was 16 and he was 18 , '' she said .
21072424	`` He was pretty cute .
21072425	And he had this enormous personality .
21072426	They quickly were seriously in love , she said .
21072427	When she was still in high school , he told her `` I want to marry you eventually . ''
21072428	But at the age of 19 , Mitt Romney went to France on the two-year mission that most young Mormon men undertake .
21072429	With the Vietnam War heating up , he received a draft deferment .
21072430	`` He was the first Mormon I ever met , '' said Ann , who was raised an Episcopalian but converted to the Church of Latter Day Saints .
21072431	Religion could be an obstacle to Romney winning voters who are put off by McCain and Giuliani , who are both divorced and , for the former New York City mayor , on the wrong side of the abortion issue .
21072432	Admitting that he has changed his mind on the emotional issue , Romney is now against abortion rights .
21072433	The evolving position on abortion is not the only changing stance that has some on the right-wing of his party questioning whether Romney is truly a social conservative .
21072434	`` It 's a legitimate question .
21072435	He has clearly flip-flopped on a number of issues , including abortion and gay rights , '' said Larry Sabato , director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia and author of several books on presidential campaigns .
21072436	`` This is always a question with presidential candidates : What do they really believe in ? ''
21072437	Romney was caught in an exaggeration when he described himself as a life-long hunter and then conceded that he had been hunting only a couple of times , mostly for small game such as rabbits .
21072438	In his 1994 Senate race , Romney pledged to be a more effective champion for gay causes than Kennedy , his Democratic rival , but he opposed the decision by the state 's supreme court to legalize gay marriage .
21072439	He refused to sign a `` no-new-taxes '' pledge when running for governor in a state nicknamed `` Taxachusetts '' but has as a presidential candidate .
21072440	Even if conservative voters conclude Romney is a genuine social conservative , the question of his religion remains .
21072441	Conservative southern Christians `` wo n't vote for Mitt en masse .
21072442	There are still misgivings and misunderstandings about Mormonism , '' said the Rev. Joel Hunter of the Northland Church , an evangelical mega-congregation in Longwood , Fla.
21072443	On the moderate end of this regional religious spectrum , some voters will take a wider view of the candidate and see the `` attractive part '' of Romney -- `` his dedication to family and his values , '' said Hunter .
21072444	`` On the fundamentalist end , you have a lot of southern Christians who say , ` I 'm not voting for a Mormon .
21072445	It 's just a cult , '' said the minister .
21072446	`` I expect people to ask
21072447	questions about what I believe , '' said Romney .
21072448	`` I 'm going to stand by my faith .
21072449	There 's nothing to be embarrassed about . ''
21072450	Romney married the former Ann Davies in 1969 , soon after his mission ended and a year after his father lost the Republican nomination to Richard Nixon .
21072451	After graduating from Brigham Young University and earning both a law degree and M.B.A. from Harvard , Mitt Romney stayed in Boston and worked as a business consultant before forming his own investment firm , Bain Capital , and became wealthy helping in the start-up of firms including Staples , Sports Authority and Domino 's Pizza .
21072452	During those years , the Romney house in suburban Belmont , Mass. , was `` rowdy , rambunctious , out of control , '' said Ann .
21072453	To some outsiders , the fit , attractive , devoutly Mormon Romneys seem like the Osmonds , minus Marie .
21072454	The candidate joked about the image to Jay Leno on `` The Tonight Show . ''
21072455	Romney said he likes `` kick back and have a good time '' but juicy details will never come out in the media because `` What goes on in Disneyland stays in Disneyland . ''
21072456	The sons -- who share a `` Five Brothers '' campaign blog -- all went on Mormon missions and all are now married .
21072457	Mitt and Ann have ten grandchildren .
21072458	Romney supporters believe the candidate 's family personifies the issues that will help him win over Southern voters .
21072459	Romney recalled a T-shirt that he saw at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference in Memphis last year .
21072460	`` It said : ` Yankee Governor .
21072461	Southern Values ' . ''

21275090	For the first time since the Advertising Council was founded in 1942 , the organization -- which directs and coordinates public service campaigns on behalf of Madison Avenue and the media industry -- is introducing ads meant to tackle a social issue of concern to gays and lesbians .
21275091	The campaign , which is scheduled to be announced by the council in Washington on Wednesday , will seek to discourage bullying and harassment of teenagers who are gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgender .
21275092	The campaign , created pro bono by the New York office of Arnold Worldwide , urges an end to using derogatory language , particularly labeling anything deemed negative or unpleasant as `` so gay . ''
21275093	That is underlined by the theme of the campaign : `` When you say , ` That 's so gay , ' do you realize what you say ?
21275094	Knock it off . ''
21275095	There will be television and radio commercials , print and outdoor ads and a special Web site devoted to the campaign -LRB- thinkb4youspeak .
21275096	com -RRB- .
21275097	Some spots feature celebrities , the young actress Hilary Duff and the comedian Wanda Sykes , delivering the message .
21275098	The campaign is on behalf of a nonprofit organization in New York called the Gay , Lesbian and Straight Education Network , or GLSEN -LRB- pronounced glisten -RRB- , which promotes tolerance among students .
21275099	GLSEN is spending about $ 2 million to develop and produce the campaign .
21275100	The introduction of the campaign will be accompanied by GLSEN 's release of the 2007 edition of an annual report , the National School Climate Survey .
21275101	The survey will report that 9 in 10 teenagers who are lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender said they were verbally harassed during the last school year .
21275102	Almost half said they were also physically harassed because of their sexual orientation .
21275103	The campaign is `` something I dreamed about for 10 years , '' said Kevin Jennings , the founder and executive director at GLSEN , and has been in active development for two years .
21275104	`` If you follow hateful language , you eventually get hurtful behavior , '' he added .
21275105	`` The chain of events begins with kids learning it 's OK to disrespect people . ''
21275106	The campaign is `` a very bold step '' on the part of the council , Jennings said , in that `` this will be , by a million miles , the largest public education campaign on LGBT issues . ''
21275107	`` I think they know they 're going to take some flak , '' he added , referring to the leadership of the council .
21275108	Peggy Conlon , the president and chief executive of the council , said she did not believe , however , that there would be negative reaction .
21275109	`` Before GLSEN made the investment , we agreed we would poll the media community , '' Conlon said , to determine how receptive outlets like newspapers , magazines , television and radio stations and Web sites would be to run such ads .
21275110	In conversations with public service directors -- the staff members at media outlets who help determine which pro bono campaigns run -- `` a very small percentage said they would not run the work , '' she said , `` not because it was ` radioactive , ' but because they thought it was not appropriate for their target audience , '' which may be older than those to whom the campaign is addressed .
21275111	As for this being the first campaign under the aegis of the council to tackle discrimination against gays and lesbians , Conlon said , `` we always had dialogue with that community , '' which had been `` focused on a different issue , '' AIDS prevention .
21275112	`` We 're always looking for important messages on discrimination , '' she said .
21275113	`` We thought this would be a fabulous campaign to take on because it 's surprising how pervasive this language is . ''
21275114	The council has presented anti-discrimination campaigns like `` A mind is a terrible thing to waste , '' for the United Negro College Fund , and ads promoting gender equality -LRB- `` Expect the best from a girl and that 's what you 'll get '' -RRB- .
21275115	In the commercial featuring Sykes , three teenage boys at a pizzeria are making fun of a silly statue of a pizza chef .
21275116	One says , `` That 's so gay , really gay , '' to which Sykes replies , `` Please do n't say that , '' and then asks how he would like it if she were to say something she disliked was `` so ' 16-year-old boy with a cheesy mustache . ' ''
21275117	Some print ads are taking a similar tack .
21275118	`` That 's so ` Jock who can complete a pass but not a sentence , ' '' one headline reads .
21275119	Another says , `` That 's so ` Gamer guy who has more video games than friends . ' ''
21275120	The ads end this way : `` Think that 's mean ?
21275121	How do you think ` That 's so gay ' sounds ?
21275122	Hurtful .
21275123	So , knock it off . ''
21275124	It is a tricky task to create a campaign that speaks to young people in a tone they do not deem patronizing or condescending .
21275125	To accomplish that , the campaign was researched and tested with the intended audience .
21275126	`` Kids that age are tough and media savvy ; they see through things quickly , '' said John Staffen , chief creative officer at Arnold NYC , part of the Arnold Worldwide unit of Havas .
21275127	As a result , `` you ca n't be too preachy , '' he added , `` and you ca n't sell too hard . ''
21275128	So the goal was `` to show the situation in a new light , '' Staffen said , `` to point out this language can be hurtful and let the kids make their own decisions . ''
21275129	`` Ultimately , we believe they will make the right decision , '' he added .
21275130	Two students who were shown the ads to elicit their reactions praised the approach .
21275131	`` These ads do a great job of making you stop and think , '' said David Aponte , 16 , a junior at Battlefield High School in Haymarket , Va. , who described himself as a `` straight ally '' of GLSEN and other organizations doing similar work .
21275132	`` I think people could connect to them , '' he added .
21275133	Lynnette Schweimler , 17 , a senior at Thunderridge High School in Highlands Ranch , Colo. , said she hoped the campaign would `` open people 's eyes a little bit . ''
21275134	Schweimler said that when she was attacked last year by assailants who singled her out for being a lesbian , `` they used a lot of derogatory language . ''
21275135	The repeating of such language `` builds up intolerance , '' she said , because `` it 's used so often , people do n't understand the meaning of it . ''

21496934	ATLANTA -- A wave of panic rippled through Atlanta 's business community over the possibility of a merger between Delta Air Lines and United Airlines that would move the combined airlines ' headquarters to Chicago .
21496935	But business leaders also said they would do everything they could to make sure that would n't happen .
21496936	`` Here we go again , '' said A.J. Robinson , president of Central Atlanta Progress .
21496937	`` I 'm worried .
21496938	Knowing what I know , we are at risk .
21496939	Now you have $ 100-a-barrel oil , and there are all these global issues .
21496940	It could be a perfect storm .
21496941	But I hope not . ''
21496942	Business leaders were adamant that they would mount a campaign to keep Delta based in Atlanta similar to the one that was launched last summer when US Airways was on the prowl .
21496943	`` The commitment of Atlanta to keep Delta is unwavering , '' said Sam Williams , president of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce .
21496944	`` It always has been and always will be : ` Keep Delta My Delta . '
21496945	I 'm satisfied that -LRB- Delta CEO -RRB- Richard Anderson knows that . ''
21496946	Williams , however , added that the metro chamber is supportive of Delta merging with another airline `` as long as the headquarters stays in Atlanta . ''
21496947	The emergence of Atlanta and Delta on the world stage occurred simultaneously .
21496948	The Atlanta business community recognizes that much of its economic growth is due to Delta 's nonstop flights to destinations in Europe , Latin America , Asia and now Africa and the Middle East .
21496949	A loss of the headquarters -LRB- and perhaps the name -RRB- could mean that the economic connection between Delta and Atlanta would suffer .
21496950	`` That would obviously hurt Atlanta , '' said Dan Papp , president of Kennesaw State University , who has a background in international relations .
21496951	`` We just had two victories .
21496952	We were able to keep Delta and were able to get the Shanghai route .
21496953	And now this .
21496954	You can go virtually anywhere in the world from Atlanta .
21496955	And this little old Southern town is now recognized around the world . ''
21496956	The campaign to keep Delta in Atlanta was embraced not only by business and government leaders but by Delta 's more than 26,000 employees in the state , which includes 3,365 at the headquarters .
21496957	Any change in ownership and headquarters would hurt those employees , said Bill Linginfelter , who just stepped down as president of Wachovia-Georgia .
21496958	Last month , Anderson had dinner with about a dozen local business leaders .
21496959	At that dinner , Atlanta leaders reinforced the sentiment of how important the airline was to the local economy .
21496960	And according to a couple of executives who were present , Anderson said that if there were to be any merger , Delta 's headquarters would remain in Atlanta .
21496961	`` I love Delta , '' said Kessel Stelling Jr. , president of Bank of North Georgia and incoming chairman of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce .
21496962	Stelling worked in marketing at Delta for 18 months in the early 1980s .
21496963	`` They are such a part of the fabric of Atlanta .
21496964	I would hate to see any business deal that would involve them moving their headquarters . ''
21496965	Michael Robison , chairman of the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau and CEO of Lanier Holdings , said losing Delta would be another economic blow to the region .
21496966	`` From an Atlanta economic development standpoint , we are obviously concerned about the loss of another Fortune 500 company .
21496967	We 've lost too many of those , '' Robison said .
21496968	`` We need to encourage the leaders at Delta to find any way possible to keep our hometown airline at home . ''
21496969	One executive , however , was not wringing his hands about a possible Delta merger .
21496970	Joe Leonard , chairman of Orlando-based AirTran , has resisted moving his airline 's headquarters to Atlanta to end up in Delta 's shadow .
21496971	Already , Atlanta is AirTran 's operations hub .
21496972	`` There 's a lot of speculation out there , and I think there will be consolidation , '' Leonard said .
21496973	`` Four of the top six guys -LRB- airlines -RRB- say consolidation should happen .
21496974	United-Delta would be a strong airline .
21496975	If any of these mergers were to occur , I would think the Department of Justice would require them to divest where there 's overlap , and that would be an opportunity for AirTran . ''

22366199	Perhaps no event in baseball history has better epitomized the Yogi Berra adage `` it 's like deja vu all over again '' than the untimely end of the Mets ' 2008 season .
22366200	Just as in 2007 , the team coughed up a September lead in the standings and fell one game out of a playoff spot with two to play .
22366201	Just as in 2007 , an inspired pitching performance against Florida in the penultimate game of the year lifted the Mets back into a tie .
22366202	And just as in 2007 , they wilted on the season 's final Sunday while their rivals triumphed .
22366203	Thus begins the latest edition of the Mets ' winter blame game , a tradition that is sadly becoming as reliable a Queens fixture as the planes landing at La Guardia .
22366204	Fans often tend to hold stars accountable when their teams fall short , reasoning that the players earning the big bucks should shoulder the responsibility for the club 's failings .
22366205	But the story of the 2008 Mets is not one of marquee players failing to live up to their billing .
22366206	Instead , it was the soft underbelly of the roster that was painfully and repeatedly exposed during the season .
22366207	In a tight race like this one , a few warm bodies would have made all the difference .
22366208	After last year 's momentous collapse , general manager Omar Minaya convinced fans that 2008 would be different by outmaneuvering a crowded field of suitors for Johan Santana , the game 's best pitcher for the previous five years .
22366209	The 2007 club missed the postseason by a single game ; with the addition of Santana , a playoff spot seemed a foregone conclusion .
22366210	Santana did not disappoint , leading the National League in innings and earned run average .
22366211	Yet the Mets won just one more game with Santana than they did the previous year without him .
22366212	What happened to the rest of the team , causing Santana 's masterful pitching to be squandered ?
22366213	The rest of the Mets ' core actually exceeded the high expectations set for them .
22366214	David Wright and Carlos Beltran would be strong contenders for most valuable player had the team made the playoffs .
22366215	Wright 's .390 on-base percentage and .534 slugging percentage were second among NL third basemen , and Beltran 's marks of .376 and .500 were tops among the league 's full-time center fielders .
22366216	Jose Reyes increased his slugging percentage by more than 50 points from 2007 and remained a potent threat on the bases with 56 steals ; only Hanley Ramirez of Florida was a superior shortstop in the NL .
22366217	Carlos Delgado enjoyed a nice comeback season at first base , finishing third in the league with 38 home runs .
22366218	With so many outstanding performances , the Mets should have waltzed into the playoffs .
22366219	But those efforts were negated by unfathomably poor showings from the back of the roster .
22366220	Where the Mets did n't have a star , they did n't have a prayer .
22366221	Second base was a sinkhole : Luis Castillo , who snookered Minaya for a $ 25 million deal last November , produced a .305 slugging percentage .
22366222	Injuries to Ryan Church and Moises Alou left the outfield corners in tatters , forcing the Mets to hand 270 at-bats to the defensive specialist Endy Chavez -LRB- .330 slugging percentage -RRB- .
22366223	The back of the rotation proved disastrous , as Pedro Martinez compiled a 5.61 ERA , and a parade of rookies and journeymen took similar lumps when he and John Maine were on the disabled list .
22366224	Finally , the bullpen was nothing short of horrifying , ranking 13th in the league in ERA and blowing 29 of the 72 save opportunities .
22366225	The hardest part of assembling a playoff-caliber team is acquiring the stars , a task the Mets have performed admirably .
22366226	But if there is a broad lesson to be learned from the 2008 Mets , it is the intrinsic limit to the impact a single player can make on a baseball team .
22366227	In basketball and football , coaches can funnel the ball to their stars as much as they wish .
22366228	But all position players in baseball must wait their turn to bat , and physiology puts a ceiling on the number of innings a pitcher can throw .
22366229	As a result , great baseball players are much less able to compensate for weak teammates than their counterparts in other sports .
22366230	Investing in the back of the roster to ensure nearly league - average performances across the board does n't generate headlines , but it is critical to building a successful team .
22366231	Although Minaya has made a number of dramatic acquisitions , he has failed miserably to minimize his club 's vulnerabilities .
22366232	Injuries to his aging veterans were inevitable , and Minaya could have easily bolstered the Mets ' depth on the free-agent market .
22366233	Outfielder Milton Bradley -LRB- who led the American League in on-base percentage -RRB- and starter Kyle Lohse -LRB- who won 15 games -RRB- were available for one-year deals in the $ 4 million to $ 5 million range .
22366234	Once the team 's weaknesses became clear , Minaya could have traded for Seattle 's Raul Ibanez , or San Francisco 's Ray Durham -- or signed Barry Bonds , who was available for the minimum salary .
22366235	But Minaya seemed confident that the team 's stars would carry the club to the postseason .
22366236	Now he will have an unexpectedly long off-season to reflect on his mistakes .
22721789	WASHINGTON
22721790	Representatives for the National Association of Evangelicals , which calls itself America 's largest evangelical Christian organization , joined with scientists from Harvard 's Center for Health and the Global Environment to announce a joint effort Wednesday to lobby lawmakers to combat global warming .
22721791	The new partners issued what they called an `` urgent call to action '' to protect `` Creation , '' or global resources , by fighting pollution and other threats to the environment .
22721792	A joint statement signed by 28 evangelical and scientific leaders was sent to President Bush , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , and members of Congress .
22721793	The coalition was initiated by Dr. Eric Chivian , director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment , an organization at Harvard Medical School focused on global environment change .
22721794	Chivian told a press conference that scientists from the center had much in common with NAE representatives in their dedication to protecting the planet .
22721795	`` We discovered that we shared a deep moral commitment to preserve this precious gift we have all been given , '' he said .
22721796	`` That is why we are here today and why we are releasing this joint statement . ''
22721797	The statement urged national leaders , including religious leaders , to take responsibility for environmental problems and to `` act now to work toward the fundamental change in values , lifestyles , and public policies required to address these worsening problems before it is too late . ''
22721798	The NAE has pledged to encourage its pastors to preach energy conservation and stewardship of the Earth to its reported 30 million followers .
22721799	Representatives of the NAE will also meet with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials to find ways to make its churches more energy efficient .
22721800	Sen. Barak Obama , D-Ill .
22721801	praised the coalition of evangelicals and scientists in a statement issued Wednesday , saying `` it is only through such unity that we can effectively address these critical global environmental challenges . ''
22721802	The group will meet with representatives from Obama 's office Thursday and with Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz .
22721803	Sen. Barbara Boxer , D-Calif .
22721804	met with the group on Wednesday , but Natalie Ravitz , the senator 's communications director , said that Boxer had no comment about the meeting .
22721805	Last February , the NAE backed down from taking a stance against global warming when then-president Ted Haggard , who was in favor of doing so , received a letter from over 20 evangelical leaders warning him that `` Bible-believing evangelicals ... disagree about the cause , severity and solutions to the global warming issue . ''
22721806	Haggard , a Colorado Springs , Colo.-based pastor , resigned in November after admitting to drug use and a relationship with a male prostitute .
22721807	Joel Hunter , a pastor at Northland Church in Orlando , Fla. , told the news conference that preconceptions about global warming held by many evangelicals will be difficult to overcome .
22721808	`` There will be skeptics , we have them in our community , '' he said .
22721809	`` There are people who link environmentalists with some kind of pagan religion . ''
22721810	However , Hunter said the partnership with the Harvard center was an opportunity to reach out to the evangelical community .
22721811	`` They have the facts we need to present to our congregations , '' he said .
22721812	`` We have the number of activists that will work through churches , government , and the business community to make a significant impact . ''

22791137	Quality gain has dealers in a bind
22791138	With less warranty work , Ford is trying to increase aftermarket parts sales and service .
22791139	By Bryce G. Hoffman
22791140	The Detroit News
22791141	Ford Motor Co. is improving the quality of its cars and trucks but , in an ironic twist , the gains come at a price for dealers who have come to depend on regular warranty work to keep their stores in the black .
22791142	Dealers know that having better vehicles will help them in the long run , but they are looking to the automaker for help developing other parts of their business to offset the loss in warranty business .
22791143	This week , Ford delivered with several new programs .
22791144	`` We are working on giving them the tools to improve their retail parts and service business , '' Ford Americas President Mark Fields told the News .
22791145	`` We need our dealer partners to be successful .
22791146	But the real benefit to the dealers is that , as we continue to improve our quality , we 're going to get more people into the showrooms and we 're going to sell more cars . ''
22791147	In the meantime , Ford is expanding its aftermarket replacement parts and accessories business to help dealers .
22791148	As they gathered for their annual conference in Las Vegas this week , Ford unveiled a new brand called `` Customs '' that will offer everything from bug - shields to bed-liners for Ford vehicles .
22791149	The focus will be on high-profit items like custom wheels and electronics , said Jay Davis , general marketing manager for Ford 's customer service division .
22791150	He said Ford will also give dealers e-commerce tools to build their customization business online .
22791151	`` As the market moves , we need to move with them , '' Davis said .
22791152	`` All of these things help build owner loyalty . ''
22791153	Dealers profit on warranty work
22791154	General Motors Corp. is seeing some decline in warranty work at its U.S. dealerships and also is working to expand dealers ' retail service business .
22791155	Chrysler LLC said it is not a major issue .
22791156	Experts say that if Ford was selling more vehicles , the decline in warranty business would be less of an issue .
22791157	But Ford 's U.S. market share has been declining since the mid-1990s .
22791158	Paul Taylor , chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association , said dealers lose an average of $ 30 on each new car and truck they sell and make it up in other parts of their business , such as financing and service .
22791159	But loss is much greater for the typical U.S. brand dealer than for the typical Asian brand dealer .
22791160	That means domestic brand dealers need to make more money off things like warranty work .
22791161	But warranty work generated just under $ 7.7 billion for U.S. dealers last year , Taylor said , a 2 percent decline over 2006 .
22791162	Ford , which has had the strongest quality gains of any of the domestic automakers , saw its warranty business decline by 12 percent nationwide during the same period , after a similar drop between 2005 and 2006 .
22791163	`` It 's something I hear about from dealers , '' said Curt Yun , director of global warranty analysis at Ford , who said the automaker 's warranty costs dropped $ 1 billion last year worldwide .
22791164	`` That 's more money for us to invest back into the business , back into new products . ''
22791165	Dave Knittel knows the problem all too well .
22791166	Things are quiet these days in the service bays at Charlotte County Lincoln Mercury in Florida , where he is the general manager .
22791167	A little too quiet .
22791168	`` Ford 's cars do n't break down anymore , '' Knittel sighs .
22791169	`` You do n't see the amount of warranty work we used to . ''
22791170	In 2001 , Knittel 's store did $ 400,000 in warranty work .
22791171	By 2006 , that figure had dropped to $ 93,000 .
22791172	And last year looks to have been even lower .
22791173	Knittel remembers a time when he did as much as $ 100,000 in warranty work in a month .
22791174	Ford and Lincoln Mercury dealers across the country are reporting declines that , if not as steep as Knittel 's , nonetheless represent a substantial blow to their bottom lines .
22791175	Michael Kennedy , who owns four Ford stores in the greater Philadelphia area , knows that Ford 's improving quality is good news for his business in the long run .
22791176	But he still has to deal with a 40 percent decline in warranty business over the past two years .
22791177	`` It 's a double-edged sword , '' he said .
22791178	`` Financially , it hurts a little bit .
22791179	And it could push some of the smaller dealers over the edge .
22791180	But it also means we 're going to do more repeat business . ''
22791181	Kennedy also owns a Chevrolet franchise .
22791182	Warranty work is down there , too , he said , but not to the same degree it is at his Ford stores .
22791183	Less recalls mean less service work
22791184	Professor Jeff Bennett of Northwood University in Midland , an expert in the retail auto market , said nearly every manufacturer is seeing some decline in warranty costs because quality is improving across the board .
22791185	He said recalls are down dramatically since 1999 , when nearly 20 million cars and trucks were recalled in the United States -- 3 million more than were sold that year .
22791186	That may have been good news for service writers , but it was a major contributor to the decline in U.S. brands like Ford , once known for their quality .
22791187	`` It used to be that dealers looked at their service departments as a necessary evil , '' Bennett said .
22791188	`` It was not a profit center . ''
22791189	That began changing in the late 1970s when cars became increasingly computerized .
22791190	At the same time , U.S. manufacturers began heaping big discounts on their products to compete with newcomers from Japan .
22791191	That undercut dealer profits from new car sales , forcing them to rely more on their warranty business .
22791192	Ford is trying to help its dealers change the equation again by beefing up their retail parts and service business .
22791193	It began a couple of years ago by offering to help dealers set up `` Quick Lane '' service bays to handle routine maintenance like oil changes .
22791194	Earlier this year , Ford began rolling out a new rewards program called `` Owner Advantage '' that offers customers incentives to take their vehicles to their dealership for such routine work .
22791195	In addition to marketing support , Ford will be mailing customers credit cards pre-loaded with $ 10 that they can use for things like tune-ups at their dealership .
22791196	Many of these changes are being pushed by Jim Farley , Ford 's new global chief of marketing , sales and service .
22791197	He knows how important the retail parts and service business can be to dealers from his days as a Toyota Motor Corp. executive , NADA 's Taylor said .
22791198	The aftermarket parts business is worth more than $ 45 billion annually , and Toyota is one of the leaders .
22791199	`` Ford 's focus on it has not been as comprehensive as Toyota 's , '' Taylor said .
22791200	`` That certainly is an opportunity not to be missed . ''

22791202	Pros and cons of quality :
22791203	Ford is helping dealers cope with reduced service appointments at their shops by :
22791204	Starting a new brand called `` Customs '' that will sell aftermarket parts and accessories .
22791205	Helping dealers set up `` Quick Lane '' service bays for oil changes and other routine maintenance .
22791206	Offering a rewards program called `` Owner Advantage '' that offers customers incentives such as gift certificates to get them to use dealer services .

23165982	JOHANNESBURG , South Africa
23165983	The governing party in oil-rich Angola won a landslide victory in the country 's first elections in 16 years , official results released Tuesday show , prompting a remarkable concession of defeat by the leading opposition party , which just six years ago was the government 's enemy in a brutal 27-year civil war .
23165984	The decisive win for the governing Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola , known as the MPLA , in last week 's legislative elections will give it the two-thirds majority in parliament needed to change the constitution and further entrench its dominance of Angolan politics , senior officials in both parties said Tuesday .
23165985	It will also confer a measure of legitimacy on a government that has been in power since Angola gained its independence from Portugal in 1975 .
23165986	While American and European election observers concluded that the political playing field was hardly level given the MPLA 's control of state media , they also said the election itself was evidence of democratic progress .
23165987	`` Again , we congratulate the people of Angola on their participation in this important step in strengthening their democracy , '' the U.S. Embassy 's election observation team said in a statement on Tuesday .
23165988	The tranquillity that prevailed as millions of Angolans went to the polls last week and the acceptance of the outcome by the opposition party , the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola , or UNITA , set this election apart from Angola 's calamitous last vote , in 1992 .
23165989	At that time , UNITA 's guerrilla leader , Jonas Savimbi , refused to accept his second-place finish and the civil war that had already killed hundreds of thousands of people resumed for another decade , ending only when Savimbi was killed in a firefight in 2002 .
23165990	Shadowed by that woeful history , UNITA accepted its defeat this time despite what observers said were flaws in the voting process in Luanda , the capital .
23165991	`` We do n't want to create a situation where this drags on for weeks and weeks , '' Jardo Muekalia , UNITA 's representative for electoral issues , said in an interview on Tuesday .
23165992	`` We want to make sure for peace and stability 's sake we end this on a high note . ''
23165993	The official tally , posted Tuesday on the election commission 's Web site , showed the MPLA with about 82 percent of the vote to UNITA 's 10 percent , with more than 80 percent of the vote counted .
23165994	The rest of the votes were divided among a dozen other parties and coalitions .
23165995	Officials in both the main parties agreed the MPLA would have a two-thirds legislative majority .
23165996	The European Union 's election observer mission found that Angola 's elections fell short of international standards because the state-controlled radio , television and daily newspaper were biased in favor of the government and because of flaws in some election procedures .
23165997	Voter lists were distributed too late to be posted in most areas , making it impossible to check who had voted , though the use of indelible ink on voters ' fingers helped guard against double voting , the EU mission found .
23165998	There were also widespread delays in the opening of many polling places in Luanda and a failure to deliver sufficient ballots to them .
23165999	The election authorities also did not accredit hundreds of trained election observers in Luanda , the mission said .
23166000	Still , the EU 's report said , the elections had been peaceful and showed the Angolan people 's `` clear commitment to the country 's democratic process and desire to leave behind a past marked by decades of war and civil conflict . ''
23166001	The MPLA 's margin of victory leaves UNITA even more marginalized -- a situation that some analysts worried could weaken the much - needed development of an effective political opposition .
23166002	The public money each party receives is based on its number of parliament seats , and UNITA will have fewer now .
23166003	It could regain a foothold if the government follows through on plans to hold local elections in a couple of years .
23166004	Even with this election win , Angola 's governing elite will still be stuck with a reputation for self-dealing and corruption that shows up in studies by Transparency International and the World Bank Institute .
23166005	`` There 's a risk they will become more arrogant , '' said Indira Campos , a researcher for Chatham House , a London policy research organization .
23166006	Or as Isabel Emerson , Angola country director for the National Democratic Institute , a Washington-based nonprofit group , said : `` The fact that they won such a vast majority will translate into a one party state practically .
23166007	I hope they see it as a wake-up call . ''
23166008	Manuel Fragata de Morais , the MPLA 's information secretary in Luanda , said Tuesday that the party felt the weight on its shoulders .
23166009	`` If Angola 's a one-party state , it would be for the first time by popular vote , '' he exclaimed .
23166010	`` So we 're not worried by that .
23166011	But seriously , we have to be very humble , serene and serious or otherwise we could pay seriously in public support . ''
23193453	MANCHESTER , N.H.
23193454	At the Merrimack Restaurant on Elm Street , where a mural of past presidential candidates adorns the red brick facade , Maria Saitas is worried .
23193455	Not only will New Hampshire 's primary be over earlier than ever next year , but the window between the Iowa and New Hampshire contests -- a mere five days in early January -- will be wincingly brief .
23193456	`` We 'll absolutely lose money , '' said Saitas , who bought the restaurant with her sister in 1981 and has welcomed virtually every major presidential candidate since then .
23193457	`` The more time they spend here , the better off we are . ''
23193458	She is among many New Hampshire residents grumbling about the circumstances that led their state to schedule its primary for Jan. 8 , a decision meant to protect its influential role in the presidential race as dozens of other states move up their nominating contests .
23193459	Restaurants and hotels are anticipating less business , but some state officials and residents fear worse : that the short interval after the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 3 will mean less attention from the candidates and insufficient time to mull Iowa 's results before casting their own votes .
23193460	`` I wish we could go back to the '70s , when there was a full month between the two states , '' said Raymond Buckley , chairman of the state Democratic Party .
23193461	`` With all the candidates trying to divide their time between the two states , they are wasting an inordinate amount of money and jet fuel and maybe not really getting to know the communities . ''
23193462	But William M. Gardner , New Hampshire 's longtime secretary of state , said pride should remain the dominant emotion here , despite the compressed schedule .
23193463	Gardner pointed to a study by the University of New Hampshire in 2000 that showed that a primary here had a smaller economic impact than a single weekend of NASCAR races at the New Hampshire International Speedway in Loudon .
23193464	`` This primary was never about the money for us , '' said Gardner , who settled on Jan. 8 last week after Michigan 's primary was set for Jan. 15 .
23193465	`` There 's a reason we have it , but it 's not economics or fame . ''
23193466	Under state law , New Hampshire must hold its primary at least seven days before any `` similar election , '' a tradition Gardner calls crucial for the nation as a whole .
23193467	-LRB- Iowa 's caucuses can come earlier because they are different from the primary process . -RRB-
23193468	`` Our law only says that whatever happens here , there needs to be time for the rest of the nation to reflect afterward , '' said Gardner , a Democrat .
23193469	`` That 's what 's important . ''
23193470	The New Hampshire and Michigan primaries will be followed by contests in Nevada , South Carolina and Florida by month 's end .
23193471	More than 20 states have scheduled their contests for Feb. 5 , the earliest date allowed by the parties without special exception .
23193472	At the Wayfarer Inn in Bedford , where news media outlets from around the world have booked rooms and paid impressive bar and restaurant tabs in past primary seasons , a manager said CBS and Time magazine had booked all 175 of its rooms at $ 249 apiece for a week in early January .
23193473	But the manager , Ian Braziller , said reporters used to stay at least three days longer .
23193474	Making matters worse , the Wayfarer had to turn down requests from wedding parties and other groups seeking rooms in January while it waited for Gardner to choose a primary date .
23193475	It was worth it , Braziller said -- in election years , the hotel gets more than 10 percent of its business from the lead-up to the primary -- but still nerve-racking .
23193476	`` We were stuck in limbo for months , '' Braziller said , `` and it was really tough . ''
23193477	Others found a bright side , saying the candidates began visiting much earlier than usual because it was clear that New Hampshire 's primary would come unusually early .
23193478	`` It started so early this year that we have pictures of some of the candidates wearing shorts , '' said Paul Manuel , executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College in Manchester .
23193479	`` In the past , we 've only seen them in parkas . ''
23193480	Andrew E. Smith , director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center , said most of the state did not reap any economic benefit from primary season , because the population , and hence campaign events , were concentrated in the southeast corner .
23193481	One television station , WMUR in Manchester , gets a lot of advertising revenue , Smith said -- including so much from Steve Forbes , a Republican candidate in 1996 and 2000 , that the station built a new wing known locally as `` The House That Forbes Built . ''
23193482	`` But the perception that there 's a tremendous amount of money coming into the state is just not accurate , '' Smith said .
23193483	On the other hand , he said , the briefer window between the Iowa and New Hampshire contests could hurt candidates who lose a tight race in Iowa .
23193484	`` If a Clinton or a Romney gets beaten in Iowa and is banking on New Hampshire as a firewall state , '' Smith said , `` it gives their campaign less time to come back . ''
23193485	But Manuel said New Hampshire voters were too independent to be swayed by what happened in Iowa , even if they had less time to make their own decisions .
23193486	He pointed to a beloved phrase here : `` In Iowa they pick corn ; in New Hampshire they pick presidents . ''
23193487	`` If that theory holds up , certainly it wo n't matter if it 's one day , five days or 100 '' between the contests , he said .
23193488	`` Then again , we have n't been here before .
23193489	It 's going to be interesting to find out . ''
23563331	Smaller businesses in Massachusetts would pay lower taxes , but large out-of-state companies with operations in the Bay State would pay more under changes to the state 's tax code moving through Beacon Hill , revenue specialists said .
23563332	The House of Representatives last week approved Governor Deval Patrick 's proposal to change the way Massachusetts calculates businesses tax liabilities , particularly for those companies that have operations in multiple locations .
23563333	Currently corporations pay taxes only on the income earned by their Massachusetts units .
23563334	This method has spawned an industry of tax schemes for companies to minimize liabilities by dividing profits and losses strategically among various units .
23563335	The new mechanism would use what 's known as `` combined reporting , '' in which a company 's profits are taxed according to a formula that considers its sales , payroll , and capital assets in the state .
23563336	Twenty-one states have adopted a form of combined reporting to deter tax avoidance among companies .
23563337	The Massachusetts proposal now goes before the state Senate .
23563338	A spokesman for Senate President Therese Murray said she has n't yet disclosed a proposal on corporate taxes .
23563339	The Patrick administration estimates a change to combined reporting would raise an additional $ 188 million in revenue next year .
23563340	But opponents said that with the economy slowing , now is a bad time for any tax increase on large companies that sustain huge numbers of jobs .
23563341	`` I ca n't define an exact group who will be impacted , but what I do know is the weight of this will fall most heavily on large , multistate corporations that employ hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts citizens , '' said Michael Widmer , president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation , a nonprofit business advocacy group .
23563342	Another business leader , Alan G. Macdonald of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable , cited Procter & Gamble , the Ohio consumer products giant that bought Gillette Co. in 2005 , as the type of company that would face a much higher tax bill on , for example , assets such as its razor-making plant in South Boston .
23563343	A P&G spokeswoman said the company would n't talk about specific tax payments but said the company supports the positions of groups , including the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce , which have called for lower Massachusetts corporate tax rates .
23563344	Meanwhile , the new method could result in lower taxes for small - to-midsize companies that have most or all of their operations here in Massachusetts .
23563345	`` More often than not , the companies based here who have no operations outside the state are the winners , '' said Tarra Curran , principal of Tofias PC , an accounting and tax firm in Cambridge .
23563346	For example , she said a local company with several hundred million dollars in revenue that currently pays millions in taxes may see its annual tax bill reduced around one hundred thousand dollars or more .
23563347	Macdonald added that only a few small companies in his membership said they would benefit from the tax change .
23563348	Chiefly the executives in his group are worried the new measure will make their tax returns more complicated .
23563349	`` They 're split , but mostly they 're not happy because of the extra level of complexity '' and more payments , he said .
23563350	To minimize what would be a large tax increase , the legislation would lower the overall tax rate charged to corporations from the current 9.5 percent .
23563351	The measure passed by the House , for example , would reduce rates to as low as 7.5 percent by 2011 depending on revenue growth .
23563352	The Taxpayers Foundation had previously said it would support combined reporting only if it were tied to reductions in the corporate tax rate to make the legislation revenue neutral , probably to around 7 percent .
23563353	But the original version pushed by the governor , and the one passed by the House , have rates that are n't low enough to offset the higher collections companies would have to pay .

23699783	WASHINGTON - American teens have become much less hopeful about the country 's future , but they are incredibly optimistic when it comes to their own prospects , even as they confront high fuel prices , global warming and other challenges , a survey released Tuesday found .
23699784	The nationwide survey of 1,600 high schoolers showed that teens have similar concerns about the world as their parents .
23699785	But while young people are feeling the weight of the world and worry most about the economy and jobs , the increasingly Web-savvy and entrepreneurial bunch are also confident they can still achieve life goals , the survey showed .
23699786	`` This just shows that a lot of my peers think if they do n't make a difference , nobody is going to , '' said 18-year-old Thomas Maranges of Ft. .
23699787	Lauderdale , Fla. , one of six teen panelists invited by the Horatio Alger Association to discuss results of the study .
23699788	The Virginia-based nonprofit educational organization facilitated the survey conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates of Distinguished Americans , a Washington , D.C.-based research firm .
23699789	The study , conducted periodically to gauge opinions and concerns of young people , showed a marked decline in the number of students feeling hopeful about the country 's future .
23699790	About 53 percent polled in 2008 said they were optimistic , compared to 75 percent five years ago .
23699791	Nevertheless , the vast majority , 93 percent , say they are either `` very confident '' or fairly confident about achieving their goals .
23699792	Asked about the single most important subject they can take to `` succeed in the global economy , '' science and technology ranked at the top , followed by mathematics .
23699793	As far as improving the nation 's schools , teens polled said the focus should be having more updated technology followed by making available better job-training programs .
23699794	Devron Lovick , 16 , of Philadelphia said the growth of the Internet has been both friend and enemy .
23699795	It has made connecting with friends much easier , but it has also forced him and his peers to grow up quicker as the Web has exposed them to much more information than other generations before Facebook and YouTube gained popularity .
23699796	`` Not only are our problems bigger now , but they 're more apparent , '' Lovick said .
23699797	Most teens surveyed said the outcome of the presidential race - where for the first time a black man is seen as a serious contender - could make a `` very '' or `` fairly large '' difference in the direction of the country .
23699798	Blacks felt strongest about the statement , with 83 percent agreeing , compared to 73 percent for Caucasians and 69 percent for Hispanics , the study showed .
23699799	Although few of the 13 - to 19-year-olds polled say they have been following news about the presidential election closely , campaign issues most important to them reflect what their parents and other grown-ups care about most .
23699800	The `` economy and jobs '' ranked first , followed by the Iraq war and the `` environment\/global warming . ''
23699801	Peter Hart , chairman of the research firm that conducted the study , said the results show a generation of problem solvers eager to know what 's going on in the world .
23699802	`` They approach the world with eyes wide open but they also approach the world with optimism and wide ambition , '' he said .

23788815	H&R Block cuts 575 more jobs at its Option One subsidiary .
23788816	By GENE MEYER The Kansas City Star
23788817	KANSAS CITY , Mo. -- H&R Block Inc. on Tuesday announced another round of job cuts at its Option One Mortgage Corp. subsidiary , this time eliminating 575 positions .
23788818	In May , the mortgage subsidiary announced a cut of 615 jobs .
23788819	Block said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that the cuts were part of an ongoing restructuring announced in May to reduce costs and improve efficiencies as lending is scaled back at the Irvine , Cal.-based subprime mortgage subsidiary .
23788820	The filing did not indicate where the affected employees were located .
23788821	Option One is not a significant Kansas City area employer , and most of the previously announced reductions involved California jobs .
23788822	Block said in the Tuesday filing that it expected to incur a 19 million charge against its fiscal 2008 earnings because of the restructuring , which it expects to complete by Dec. 31 .
23788823	This is in addition to an earlier 19 million charge related to the 615 job cuts .
23788824	Block has an agreement to sell Option One to Cerberus Capital Management LP by Dec. 31 for 300 million less than the subsidiary 's tangible assets when the sale closes .
23788825	The Kansas City financial services firm , however , said two weeks ago that it was trying to renegotiate that deal with Cerberus because Option One -- once the nation 's eighth-largest subprime mortgage lender -- no longer was doing the volume of business called for in the original sales agreement .
23788826	Block executives said then they probably would shut down Option One 's lending operations if the Cerberus deal fell through and sell the unit 's loan servicing separately .
23788827	Last Thursday , Block shareholders overwhelming elected former SEC Chairman Richard Breeden 's slate of three directors to the company 's board .
23788828	Breeden has been pressuring Block 's management to bolster it traditional tax business and get out of other financial-services operations .
23788829	Block shares closed Tuesday at 19.81 , up 16 cents on the New York Stock Exchange .

24433082	Wall Street 's big bet on risky mortgages may be souring a lot faster than had been previously thought .
24433083	The once booming market for home loans to people with weak credit -- known as subprime mortgages and made largely to minorities , the poor and first-time buyers stretching to afford a home -- is coming under greater pressure .
24433084	The evidence can be seen in rising default rates , increasingly strained finances at mortgage lenders and growing doubts among investors .
24433085	Now , Wall Street firms , which had helped fuel the growth in the market by bankrolling and investing in subprime mortgage lenders , have begun to pinch off the money spigot .
24433086	Several mortgage lenders have recently collapsed .
24433087	While the failures so far are small in number , some industry officials are concerned that they could be the first in a wave .
24433088	The subprime sector , which produced loans worth more than $ 500 billion in the first nine months of last year , could shrink significantly .
24433089	A sharp contraction in subprime mortgages would have ripple effects , reducing consumers ' access to credit and affecting investors like foreign central banks , pensions and mutual funds that have been big buyers of mortgage-backed securities .
24433090	The recent bankruptcy of Ownit Mortgage Solutions , a lender based in Agoura Hills , Calif. , provides a cautionary tale .
24433091	Even as its revenue grew by more than a third in the first nine months of 2006 , to $ 8.3 billion , the company was losing money .
24433092	It shut down after its financial backers , which included Merrill Lynch & Co. and JPMorgan Chase , could not come up with a deal to save it .
24433093	In addition to Ownit , Sebring Capital Partners , based outside Dallas , closed in December , and Mortgage Lenders Network of Middletown , Conn. , has stopped making loans through brokers , laid off more than 800 employees and is being investigated by state regulators .
24433094	`` Pick a company -- small , medium or large -- they all have the same problem : Capital , '' said Marc A. Geredes , who runs a small mortgage company , LownHome Financial , in San Jose , Calif. `` The economics of the business do not make sense right now . ''
24433095	Wall Street firms were attracted to such lenders because they helped feed a pipeline of securities backed by the mortgages , a market bigger than the one for U.S. Treasury bonds and notes .
24433096	Merrill Lynch , for example , securitized $ 67.8 billion in residential mortgages in the first nine months of 2006 , up 58.4 percent from the period a year earlier .
24433097	But an increasing number of borrowers are defaulting on subprime loans earlier now than they did a year ago , often within six months of having taken the loan out , shaking Wall Street 's confidence in its subprime partners .
24433098	In one indication that investors are losing their taste for mortgages , hedge funds that specialize in mortgage-backed securities had an outflow of $ 1.8 billion in 2006 , down from an inflow of $ 1.8 billion in 2005 , according to Hedge Fund Research .
24433099	It was the only category of hedge funds to have a negative flow for the year .
24433100	`` We have been and continue to be cautious about the subprime market -- its lending standards , decline in home price appreciation , other deteriorating credit fundamentals , '' said Jim Higgins , chief executive of Sorin Capital Management .
24433101	While Wall Street 's tolerance for mortgage risk has waned , it is still interested in mortgage originators .
24433102	This week , Citigroup bought a mortgage servicing business from ABN Amro Holding for undisclosed terms , and Barclays Bank bought the Equifirst Corp. , a subprime lender , for $ 225 million .
24433103	But something of a shakeout has begun .
24433104	`` The pendulum swung too far the other way , '' said Guy D. Cecala , president of Inside Mortgage Finance , which publishes data and newsletters on the industry .
24433105	`` At some point , it comes back .
24433106	But what it usually takes is a little blood on the road . ''
24433107	If that is indeed how the story will play out , William D. Dallas , the founder and chief executive of Ownit , would argue that his company has become an early case of road kill .
24433108	In mid-November , JPMorgan Chase , which provided Ownit with money to make home loans , notified the company it was in default and would lose access to a $ 500 million credit line by Dec. 13 because it was losing money , had taken on too much debt and its net worth had fallen , according to bankruptcy documents and people briefed on the company 's finances .
24433109	Mortgage lenders as small as Ownit and as big as Wells Fargo sit in the middle of housing 's food chain that starts with individual home buyers and can end with investors in exotic credit derivatives on the other side of the world .
24433110	Smaller lenders like Ownit use money provided by banks like JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch to make loans that it receives from mortgage brokers who interact with and help fill in the paperwork for people buying homes or refinancing existing loans .
24433111	Once completed , the mortgages are sold to Wall Street banks that package hundreds of loans at a time into bonds that are sold to investors and traded in financial markets .
24433112	The bonds are sliced into different layers of risk and many investors typically accept lower returns in exchange for guarantees that they will be paid ahead of people in the lower - quality portions of the securities if borrowers default on mortgages .
24433113	Investors also shield themselves by requiring mortgage companies like Ownit to buy back mortgages that incur `` early payment defaults , '' an industry term for loans that have turned bad quickly .
24433114	In recent months , banks have sought the safety of these protective measures and grown pickier about the kinds of loans they will buy after noticing that a growing number of borrowers who took out loans in 2006 were falling behind on payments just a few months after they had been issued .
24433115	According to its bankruptcy filing , Ownit was asked to buy back $ 166.4 million in loans , $ 93 million of which was owed to Merrill Lynch .
24433116	Merrill Lynch owned about 20 percent of Ownit and provided a credit line worth billions of dollars to the company .
24433117	-LRB- Also in December , Merrill Lynch bought First Franklin Financial , a subprime lender co-founded by Dallas , for $ 1.3 billion from National City . -RRB-
24433118	Ownit 's strained financial circumstances set the tone for negotiations with JPMorgan , Merrill Lynch and CIVC Partners , a Chicago-based private equity firm that owns the majority of Ownit .
24433119	Dallas , who along with other executives owned about 20 percent of the company , said Merrill Lynch agreed to step in to make up Ownit 's financial shortfall and was even willing to buy the 80 percent of the company it did not already own .
24433120	But Dallas said the deal fell part on Dec. 7 , when Merrill pulled its offer of additional funds and its representative on Ownit 's board , Michael Blum , tendered his resignation by fax .
24433121	Blum , a managing director who heads structured finance at Merrill Lynch , declined to comment through a spokesman .
24433122	`` While it is unfortunate that Ownit closed its doors , we met every contractual obligation we had to them , '' William Halldin , the spokesman for Merrill Lynch , said .
24433123	`` Like its majority owner , we did not think it was in the best interests of our shareholders to make a further investment . ''
24433124	The representative of CIVC Partners on the board of Ownit , Daniel Helle , did not return calls .
24433125	for comment .
24433126	Officials at JPMorgan declined to discuss the negotiations .
24433127	-LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .
24433128	OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS . -RRB-
24433129	Dallas acknowledged that Ownit , like other subprime lenders , saw a sharp increase in defaults from new borrowers in 2006 , compared with 2005 and 2004 -- years when few loans showed early losses .
24433130	But he said the defaults were still low at 2 percent and insisted that most of those borrowers had simply missed one or two payments because they were confused about where they should mail payments because many of them had two mortgages on their homes .
24433131	Across the industry , 2.6 percent of the subprime loans securitized in the second quarter of 2006 had been foreclosed on , or had been repossessed within six months , up from 1 percent for loans securitized in the second quarter of 2005 , according to Moody 's Investors Service , the ratings agency .
24433132	Joseph Rocco , an analyst with Moody 's , notes that foreclosure rates typically rise as loans get older .
24433133	The grim statistics reflect the sharp slowdown in housing .
24433134	Home prices , for instance , in many previously hot markets on the coasts and in the Southwest are falling as sales have slackened making it harder for homeowners in a financial bind to sell their properties .
24433135	They also indicate that mortgage lenders became more generous with 100 percent financing on homes and allowed borrowers to state their incomes with little or no supporting documentation last year in an effort to bolster mortgage volumes , according to industry experts .
24433136	Banking regulators have increasingly voiced concerns about the loosening of lending practices by subprime lenders and late last year demanded that borrowers be more closely vetted before being qualified for adjustable-rate and other risky loans .
24433137	Yet , housing advocates and industry experts say policy makers are also worried that too sharp a pullback in lending by Wall Street and commercial banks could cut off consumers access to credit .
24433138	For his part , Dallas acknowledges that standards were lowered but he placed the blame at the feet of investors and Wall Street , saying they encouraged Ownit and other subprime lenders to make riskier loans to keep the pipeline of mortgage securities well supplied .
24433139	`` The market is paying me to do a no income verification loan more than it is paying me to do the full documentation loans , '' he said .
24433140	`` What would you do ? ''
24749430	OTTAWA
24749431	Both the oil industry and environmental groups were united , at least in disagreement , on Friday by the province of Alberta 's decision to raise oil and gas royalty charges .
24749432	After receiving two reports concluding that Alberta is shortchanged by energy companies , the province 's premier , Ed Stelmach , announced on Thursday night a complex series of changes to royalty charges and the system used to assess them .
24749433	According to Stelmach , the changes will bolster the province 's annual royalty income by 1.4 billion Canadian dollars , or 20 percent , when the program takes effect in 2009 .
24749434	Energy producers condemned the increase as excessive , while environmental groups called it inadequate .
24749435	Although Stelmach 's calculations were challenged on Thursday , his estimate of increased income falls well below levels recommended in a report issued last month by a special government panel .
24749436	It suggested measures that would have provided an additional 2 billion Canadian dollars a year .
24749437	Even though high oil prices have led to a boom that created labor and materials shortages in Alberta -- the center of Canada 's energy industry -- oil and gas company executives have spent the last month warning the province that higher royalties could imperil its financial future , curb investment and eliminate jobs .
24749438	Unlike Danny Williams , the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador who vigorously pushed back against such claims when his province recently sought higher energy revenues , Stelmach has taken a much more low-key approach .
24749439	Stelmach 's methods , however , did not mute the industry 's criticism .
24749440	`` Concern and disappointment would be the two words I would pick , '' said Pierre R. Alvarez , the president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers .
24749441	`` They keep looking at the government take .
24749442	We keep trying to explain to them that you have to look at the industry 's returns . ''
24749443	But Chris Severson-Baker , the director of the energy program at the Pembina Institute , which studies energy use and global warming issues , said he calculated that the net royalties on oil extracted from Alberta 's oil sands would rise 2 percent , compared with a 22 percent increase recommended by the review panel .
24749444	`` In some ways this is one big oil town , '' Severson-Baker said of Calgary , where both the Pembina Institute and Alberta 's oil industry are based .
24749445	`` When the oil industry starts threatening , people get scared even if a lot of those threats were not particularly genuine . ''
24749446	If his estimate is correct , Severson-Baker said , the low royalties on oil sands will lead to continued production increases from those operations , which are among Canada 's leading sources of emissions related to global warming .
24837673	Names began circulating in political circles Tuesday about potential replacements for Massachusetts sate Senator Jarrett T. Barrios .
24837674	Among the possible candidates was Dan Ryan , a former candidate for Boston City Council .
24837675	Ryan , a legislative aide to US Representative Michael Capuano , lost to Sal LaMattina by about 2 percent of the vote in a special election in 2006 .
24837676	`` I will take a serious look at it , '' Ryan , 38 , of Charlestown , said in a telephone interview Tuesday .
24837677	`` We 're still waiting to hear when the election would be .
24837678	I want to allow Senator Barrios to set his timetable for departure . ''
24837679	Also considering seeking the seat is Anthony D. Galluccio , a city councilor in Cambridge since 1994 .
24837680	He also served as vice mayor and mayor , positions elected by the City Council .
24837681	He chaired the Cambridge School Committee between 2000 and 2001 , when he served as mayor .
24837682	`` I 'm seriously considering it , '' said Galluccio , 39 , a lawyer from West Cambridge . ''
24837683	`` It 's an exciting opportunity , to say the least . ''
24837684	John Walsh , chairman of the state Democratic Party , said other potential candidates include state Representatives Alice K. Wolf and Eugene L. O'Flaherty .
24837685	Wolf , who did not return calls Tuesday , is a Democratic state representative from the 25th Middlesex District in Cambridge .
24837686	She was elected to the House in 1996 and previously served as mayor , vice mayor , city councilor , and as a School Committee member in Cambridge .
24837687	O'Flaherty , 38 , of Chelsea , has represented the second Suffolk District since 1996 .
24837688	He is a graduate of the Massachusetts School of Law and serves on the House Rules Committee and is House chairman of the Legislature 's Joint Committee on the Judiciary .
24837689	`` We 're in the process of digesting it , '' he said .
24837690	`` I 've begun to have some conversations with my family , and I have a large family .
24837691	It 's a decision all of us have to make . ''
24837692	Walsh said he expects the Democrats to hold the seat .
24837693	`` They all have experience running , and they run well , '' he said .
24837694	`` The good news for us is there are plenty of good , strong Democratic candidates for this seat , and we 're going to do everything we can to keep it Democratic . ''
24837695	He said the special election will probably be held in the fall .
24837696	Peter Torkildsen , chairman of the state Republican Party , said the GOP plans to field candidates in the heavily Democratic district .
24837697	Barrios won nearly 80 percent of the vote when he ran unopposed in the 2006 general election .
24837698	`` Certainly , we will be asking our Republican candidates and activists to consider this , '' Torkildsen said .
24837699	`` I never tell someone they should give up without looking .
24837700	`` I think people in Massachusetts are tired of having no competition at all , '' he said .
24837701	`` The Republican Party needs more candidates . ''

25194435	ATLANTA -- More than half of the highest-ranking executives at BellSouth wo n't be staying with the company now that it has been purchased by AT&T .
25194436	The departees include Mark Feidler , who had been considered the heir apparent to Chairman and CEO Duane Ackerman .
25194437	Feidler served as BellSouth 's president and chief operating officer and was a respected , 16-year company veteran .
25194438	According to an internal AT&T memo , the 19 execs saying goodbye also include BellSouth 's chief financial officer , chief strategy and development officer , chief marketing officer and head of Georgia operations .
25194439	No one in AT&T 's top tier of leaders - those who report directly to Chairman and CEO Ed Whitacre - is from BellSouth .
25194440	The next level , however , includes two people with close ties to the former Atlanta-based company .
25194441	They are Ralph de la Vega , group president for regional wireline operations , and Dick Anderson , group president for global business services .
25194442	They report to AT&T Chief Operating Officer Randall Stephenson .
25194443	The management moves are an early indication of the sweeping changes under way at BellSouth , which was bought by AT&T Dec. 29 for $ 85.5 billion in stock .
25194444	AT&T previously announced it is likely to shed 10,000 jobs in the buyout , chiefly through attrition .
25194445	BellSouth 's nine-state territory is morphing into the new AT&T Southeast , with headquarters in Atlanta .
25194446	Ackerman is retiring , as expected .
25194447	News of other changes had been awaited in the wake of the merger , including the futures of some of the company 's best-known leaders .
25194448	`` This is not a merger - this is an acquisition , pure and simple , '' said Jim Senn , managing director of the Center for Global Business Leadership at Georgia State University .
25194449	`` I 'm not surprised at the extent of the BellSouth management team leaving . ''
25194450	Feidler 's departure is the most prominent .
25194451	AT&T said he is leaving to `` pursue other opportunities , '' using language that has become familiar in corporate changes .
25194452	AT&T previously disclosed that Feidler would be offered a job reporting directly to Whit ?
25194453	acre , but Feidler might have faced limits on his upward mobility .
25194454	When Whitacre retires , he is expected to be replaced by Stephenson , who is roughly the same age as Feidler .
25194455	Feidler also would have needed to relocate to San Antonio .
25194456	In AT&T 's memo , Whitacre praised Feidler , particularly for helping build BellSouth 's wireless business .
25194457	Feidler was Cingular 's chief operating officer before rejoining BellSouth in 2004 .
25194458	Cingular , based in Atlanta , formerly was a joint venture of BellSouth and AT&T .
25194459	The cellphone giant is now wholly owned by AT&T and will , like BellSouth , be renamed .
25194460	Company spokesman Jeff Battcher said BellSouth 's executive officers were offered positions .
25194461	`` Officers who elected not to join the company decided to retire or to leave to pursue other interests , '' Battcher said .
25194462	The departures , which the company has said come with severance packages , include :
25194463	u2009 Pat Shannon , chief financial officer ;
25194464	u2009 Barry Boniface , chief strategy and development officer ;
25194465	Francis Dramis Jr. , chief information officer , e-commerce and security officer ;
25194466	u2009 Keith Cowan , chief field operations officer ;
25194467	u2009 Margaret Greene , president for regulatory and external affairs ;
25194468	u2009 William Pate , chief marketing officer for retail markets ;
25194469	u2009Four state presidents , including Ron Frieson of Georgia .
25194470	At Cingular , Ed Reynolds is leaving his post as president of network services .
25194471	He was a key figure in Cingular 's integration of the former AT&T Wireless .
25194472	Many BellSouth and Cingular leaders will remain with the new company , including Stan Sigman , who currently runs Cingular .
25194473	De la Vega is shifting from the No. 2 job at Cingular to the position running wireline operations for AT&T .
25194474	BellSouth 's Anderson , AT&T 's new group president for global business services , will be based in Atlanta .
25194475	BellSouth 's Richard Sibbernsen will serve as executive vice president for human resources at AT&T , and Paulino Barros will be president of global operations .
25194476	Isaiah `` Ike '' Harris , former president of BellSouth 's advertising and publishing group , will stay with the company in a similar , regional job .
25194477	Marc Gary , BellSouth 's general counsel , will continue to handle legal issues for AT&T in the Southeast .
25194478	Locally , AT&T Southeast will be run by Rod Odom , who came from BellSouth .
25194479	His top leaders are other BellSouth insiders : Bill Smith , David Scobey and Phil Jacobs .
25194480	AT&T Georgia will be led by Sylvia Anderson , a veteran of the old AT&T .
25194481	Harry Lightsey , formerly state president for BellSouth in South Carolina , is senior vice president for legislative and external affairs in the Southeast .
25194482	AT&T 's Whitacre visited Atlanta Thursday to speak to his new employees and to introduce his management team , during an event at the Fox Theatre .
25194483	He did not grant interviews .

25592022	Federal authorities have expanded an investigation into allegations that Jackson Hewitt offices helped prepare fraudulent income-tax returns that allowed customers to obtain refunds illegally .
25592023	The Justice Department filed civil lawsuits in April accusing more than 125 Jackson Hewitt offices of knowingly enabling tens of thousands of middle - and lower-income people to obtain $ 70 million by falsifying their federal tax returns .
25592024	Late last week , Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc. disclosed in a securities filing that the company itself was the subject of an Internal Revenue Service investigation .
25592025	Jackson Hewitt said in the filing that it was cooperating fully with the inquiry .
25592026	Such inquiries are typically carried out by the IRS ' criminal investigations division , and if necessary handed over to the Justice Department 's civil or criminal tax division for further investigation .
25592027	The IRS declined to comment on Monday .
25592028	Jackson Hewitt , based in Parsippany , N.J. , is the nation 's second-largest tax preparation chain after H&R Block .
25592029	The Justice Department lawsuits raised questions over Jackson Hewitt 's supervision and oversight of its franchisees , in this case of a Pakistani-born businessman named Farrukh Sohail , who has outlets in Detroit , Chicago , Atlanta , the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina and Birmingham , Ala. .
25592030	The lawsuits did not name Jackson Hewitt as a defendant .
25592031	But in its securities filing , Jackson Hewitt said : `` The company has learned recently that the Internal Revenue Service is conducting additional examinations of tax-return preparation activities of Jackson Hewitt franchisees and company-owned stores .
25592032	The company is also a subject of an IRS investigation relating to these matters . ''
25592033	Last month , Jackson Hewitt began an internal review of the company 's practices and procedures , hiring a retired IRS commissioner , Fred T. Goldberg Jr. , to oversee the review .
25592034	Goldberg , a tax lawyer at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom , was also briefly the assistant secretary for tax policy in the Treasury in the early 1990s .

25592036	In its filing on Friday , Jackson Hewitt said that it `` intends to complete the internal review promptly and to implement a variety of enhancements in the areas of compliance and monitoring for the 2008 filings season . ''
25592037	Sheila Cort , a spokeswoman for Jackson Hewitt , declined to comment further , adding that the company knew nothing more about the IRS investigation .
25592038	The lawsuits filed against the Sohail-owned or controlled franchises said that employees had been pushed to crank out returns in exchange for bribes , to accept scant or false documents , like W-2 forms , and to falsify taxpayer data to receive the earned-income tax credit , a federal assistance program .
25592039	The lawsuits also cited shoddy training , meager oversight and the ignoring of whistle-blowers at Sohail 's stores .
25592040	Jackson Hewitt temporarily suspended work at most of Sohail 's franchises .
25592041	Operators of franchises prepare returns using Jackson Hewitt 's Profiler software and then forward the returns to the main Jackson Hewitt center for approval and filing to the IRS .
26062945	An alleged Vallejo madam pleaded not guilty in a federal courtroom in the nation 's capital Friday on a federal racketeering indictment accusing her of running a $ 2 million prostitution ring in Washington , D.C.
26062946	Deborah Jeane Palfrey , 50 , was indicted last week on charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -- known as RICO -- and conspiracy to commit money laundering .
26062947	Palfrey was released on her own recognizance , but U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler ordered her to wear an ankle bracelet that would track her movements , said Montgomery Blair Sibley , who is representing her in a civil asset-forfeiture case that is now on hold because of the criminal case .
26062948	Palfrey will return to court April 14 for a status hearing .
26062949	She read a statement outside court Friday in which she denied any wrongdoing , Sibley said .
26062950	Sibley said his client operated Pamela Martin and Associates , a legal escort service , for 13 years until she closed shop in August .
26062951	She hired women who listed their earnings as independent contractors , and Palfrey had her tax returns prepared by H&R Block , which generated tax forms for all the escorts , he said .
26062952	Palfrey , who served 18 months in prison after a 1991 conviction for running a prostitution ring , said in her statement , `` Having learned from past mistakes in judgment and in order to ensure that the services provided remained within the boundaries of the law , each independent contractor signed a legally binding contract at the onset of employment stating she would not , among other things , engage in illegal behavior while employed by Pamela Martin and Associates . ''
26062953	Also Friday , Sibley filed a $ 75,000 civil lawsuit against one of Palfrey 's escorts accusing her of `` engaging in illegal sexual activities with customers of the escort service , '' a breach of the contract the escort signed with Palfrey .
26062954	`` Apparently , there were some rogue escorts who violated the rules , and that is what the government based its case upon , '' Sibley said .
26062955	`` She is not going to ignore the fact that promises that were made to her in writing have been breached .
26062956	Like any business , she has the right to seek compensation for breach of contract . ''
26062957	Authorities have already seized about $ 1 million worth of real estate and $ 500,000 in cash and stocks in the civil case , Sibley said .
26062958	Palfrey has threatened to sell detailed phone records -- weighing 46 pounds -- of some 10,000 clients since 1993 to help pay for her defense .
26062959	Earlier this week , citing Palfrey 's threats to sell client records , federal prosecutors asked Judge Kessler for a protective order that would bar Palfrey from using any evidence in the case for any purpose beyond preparing for her defense .
26062960	Palfrey 's statements `` could be considered veiled threats to cause embarrassment to former customers and employees of her escort business , '' wrote Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel Butler and Catherine Connelly .
26062961	The judge asked the attorneys Friday if they could work out the issues surrounding any protective order , Sibley said .
26062962	Authorities said Palfrey 's alleged prostitution ring involved 132 college-educated women and generated more than $ 2 million over 13 years as men paid for sex with her escorts in hotels , residences and offices in Virginia , Maryland and Washington , D.C.
26311648	Morris Talansky , the Long Island man at the heart of a corruption investigation in Israel that may topple Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , faces more legal problems when he finishes testifying and returns to New York .
26311649	Kool-Tech , a privately owned minibar company that he helped finance three years ago , and with whom he has been feuding , sued him in the trial-level state Supreme Court in Manhattan on Thursday , accusing him of breaching his fiduciary duty by seeking to help a competitor steal a multiyear contract with a New York hotel .
26311650	Talansky also faces the possibility that U.S. authorities have begun their own investigation into his business dealings with foreign officials because of antibribery statutes .
26311651	As far removed as it may seem from affairs of government , the minibar business has already figured into the Israeli investigation because of allegations that Olmert had received thousands of dollars in cash and gifts over the years from Talansky , and that Olmert may at one point have urged a wealthy casino mogul -- unsuccessfully -- to install Kool-Tech 's systems at his hotels .
26311652	Olmert and Talansky have both denied any wrongdoing to the Israeli press .
26311653	In another pending lawsuit , filed in 2007 in Nassau County , the minibar company accused Talansky of arranging improperly to have the company reimburse him for a $ 4,717.49 hotel bill he incurred at the Ritz-Carlton in Washington in October 2005 , when he treated `` a senior Israeli cabinet member that had no relation to the business '' to a night 's stay .
26311654	Though the official was not named in the lawsuit , William J. Davis , a lawyer for Kool-Tech , disclosed two weeks ago in an interview that it was Olmert , and that the hotel reservation had been made by Shula Zaken , Olmert 's longtime aide .
26311655	He said the company broke off ties with Talansky upon learning of the expenditure , largely out of a desire to steer clear of doing anything illegal or running afoul of laws like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , which prohibits bribes to foreign officials .
26311656	Davis said that he was told that the FBI had opened an investigation that included Talansky 's activities , but he said that neither he nor his client had yet been contacted by the authorities .
26311657	He would not disclose his source .
26311658	Selva Ozelli , a New York lawyer who has written extensively about the antibribery statute , agreed that paying the hotel bill for a foreign politician could violate the law if the American benefactor received something in return .
26311659	To be illegal , the payment or gift `` has to be in furtherance of their business purpose , '' she said .
26311660	No one responded to a message left at the Talansky home in Woodsburgh , N.Y. , and lawyers who have previously represented Talansky in commercial disputes either failed to return phone calls or said they had no information on the new lawsuit or the possibility of an FBI investigation .
26311661	A New York spokesman for the FBI said it was the agency 's policy not to confirm or deny investigations .
26311662	Talansky had proved helpful to Olmert when he was the mayor of Jerusalem by helping start and run the New Jerusalem Foundation , a charity meant to raise money for civic projects in Israel .
26311663	Its U.S. office was at the same address as Talansky 's home .
26311664	He was listed on tax returns as its treasurer , and his wife , Helene , was listed for a time as the organization 's secretary .
26311665	Talansky is also well known in both the United States and Israel for his work as a key fundraiser in the United States for Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem .
26311666	Tax returns show that he and his wife , a fellow employee of the hospital 's American charitable organization at the time , received more than $ 1 million in consulting fees and other payments from the organization in the seven years after they left the charity in 1997 .
26311667	When Talansky joined Kool-Tech in 2005 , his wife also obtained employment there as a bookkeeper .
26311668	One claim made by the company in the Nassau County lawsuit is that Talansky improperly withdrew $ 80,000 in company funds , falsified books to award himself $ 200,000 in extra capital and urged an employee to work for a competitor .
26311669	Talansky , meanwhile , who was the first to sue , accused the company of freezing him out of the business , failing to deliver a prototype for a new minibar , and using company funds to hire a $ 60,000-a-year personal assistant for the founder 's wife .
26311670	`` As a result , plaintiff 's investment and reputation in the business community have been greatly damaged , '' Talansky argued in the initial complaint .
26311671	In the latest lawsuit , filed in Manhattan on Thursday , Kool-Tech accused Talansky of tampering with its 10-year contract at the Excelsior Hotel in New York by aligning himself with a competitor while telling the hotel 's general manager that Kool-Tech was financially shaky and going bankrupt .
26331857	Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday unveiled a new health-care plan that would require everyone to obtain health insurance -- and prevent insurance companies from rejecting applicants .
26331858	Clinton 's new blueprint tries to avoid some of the pitfalls that stymied her 1993 efforts at health-care reform .
26331859	That attempt ended in a political flop and helped propel Republican victories in the 1994 elections that gave the GOP control of the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years .
26331860	The New York Democrat 's bid to address a public concern second - only to the Iraq war showcased both her past experience and a willingness to return to a tough , unresolved issue .
26331861	`` Perhaps more than anybody else I know just how hard this fight will be , '' Clinton told an audience at a medical center in Des Moines , Iowa .
26331862	`` I know my Republican opponents will try to equate health care for all Americans with government-run health care .
26331863	Do n't let them fool us again .
26331864	This is not government-run . ''
26331865	Clinton , a second term senator who led the Clinton administration 's health-care reform effort as first lady , said her simplified proposal would require that every man , woman and child in the United States must obtain health insurance from employers , private providers or government-subsidized programs such as Medicare .
26331866	Clinton said her proposal would prohibit health insurance companies from `` cherry picking '' healthy people for coverage and rejecting people with pre-existing medical conditions or poor health histories .
26331867	Her plan draws upon efforts in states such as California and Massachusetts to mandate health insurance coverage , with state assistance to people who can not afford the required coverage .
26331868	Clinton vowed to accomplish her version of universal health insurance coverage in her first term , if elected president .
26331869	`` I believe everyone -- every man , woman and child -- should have quality , affordable health care in America , '' Clinton said .
26331870	She estimated that her plan would cost $ 110 billion-a-year , mainly to pay for coverage for the uninsured .
26331871	She said part of this money would come from ending some of the Bush administration 's tax cuts for families earning more than $ 250,000 a year .
26331872	Clinton said her plan would not create the kind of new federal bureaucracy that her 1993 proposal envisioned , such as a regulatory National Health Board , a national health security card or statewide health alliances .
26331873	Government estimates show that roughly 253 million people have private or government health insurance coverage -- and roughly 47 million people are without health insurance .
26331874	The nation spends $ 2.3 trillion a year on health -- 17 percent of the nation 's $ 13.8 trillion gross national product .
26331875	Clinton said she would discuss her plan on a live interactive Internet web cast on Tuesday at 8 p.m. EDT at www.hillaryclinton.com .
26331876	EDWARDS THREATENS TO END PRESIDENT 'S HEALTH COVERAGE
26331877	Democratic presidential aspirant John Edwards on Monday threatened to end government health insurance coverage for the president , members of Congress and senior political appointees six months after taking office unless Congress enacted universal health care coverage .
26331878	The former one-term senator from North Carolina told a union audience in Chicago that , if elected , he would submit legislation to Congress to end coverage for top federal officials on July 20 , 2009 , unless health-care legislation had been adopted .
26331879	Edwards , fighting for the political limelight on a day when Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , D-N.Y. , outlined her version of universal health insurance coverage , said Clinton could not achieve meaningful health-insurance reform after accepting campaign donations from health insurance lobbyists .
26331880	`` I do n't believe you can sit down with the lobbyists , take their money , and cut a deal with them , '' Edwards said .
26331881	`` If you defend the system that defeated health care , I do n't think you can be a president who will bring health care . ''
26331882	Edwards , who outlined his own plan for universal health insurance coverage in February , mocked Clinton 's claim to have learned from her experience in 1993 , saying the lesson she learned was `` if you ca n't beat 'em , join 'em . ''
26331883	Sen. Barack Obama , D-Ill. , who has proposed a plan that would provide coverage for all children and require employers to share the costs of insuring workers , jabbed Clinton for using a secret task force in 1993 to develop the Clinton administration plan .
26331884	`` The real key to passing any health-care reform is the ability to bring people together in an open , transparent process that builds a broad consensus for change . ''
26331885	LIBERAL ORGANIZATION TARGETS GIULIANI FOR MISSING SESSIONS OF IRAQ PANEL
26331886	A new television campaign commercial in Iowa is accusing former New York City Mayor Rudolph of skipping meetings of the Iraq Study Group because he was out on the speaking circuit for high - paying appearances .
26331887	The liberal anti-war organization MoveOn.org said Monday it bought $ 50,000 of broadcast time in the early contest state of Iowa to accuse Giuliani of `` a betrayal of trust '' for joining the Iraq Study Group , `` skipping important meetings '' and then quitting after his speech-making caused scheduling problems .
26331888	`` Republican voters should ask : ` Giuliani , where were you when it counted , '' ' the ad said .
26331889	The organization said Giuliani raised $ 11.4 million in 14 months from speech making , including a $ 200,000 speech in South Korea on April 12 , 2006 , when the Iraq Study Group was meeting and a $ 100,000 address in Atlanta on May 18 , 2006 , when the panel was meeting in Washington , D.C.
26331890	Republicans in Iowa are scheduled to hold precinct caucuses on Jan. 14 to express preferences for the Republican presidential nominee in 2008 -- a contest that often serves as a springboard for candidates into subsequent primaries .
26331891	ROMNEY WANTS IRANIAN LEADER TO FACE INDICTMENT
26331892	Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney on Monday urged the United Nations to scrub a scheduled address by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and instead help indict him for genocide .
26331893	Romney , a former governor of Massachusetts , told U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in a letter that Ahmadinejad 's regime `` has spoken openly about wiping Israel off the map , has fueled Hezbollah 's terror campaign ... and defied the world community in its pursuit of nuclear weapons . ''
26331894	Romney told reporters : `` I think the invitation should be withdrawn .
26331895	I think instead , Ahmadinejad should be indicted under the Genocide Convention . ''

26331897	OBAMA TELLS WALL STREET TO WORRY ABOUT THE LITTLE GUY
26331898	Sen. Barack Obama , D-Ill , on Monday gave Wall Street an earful , urging the nation 's financial wizards to check their greed long enough to help `` losers in this new economy . ''
26331899	Obama , a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School , told investors at the NASDAQ Marketsite that they had `` not always concerned themselves '' with victims of the global marketplace .
26331900	`` The danger with this mentality is n't just that it offends our morals , it 's that it endangers our markets , '' Obama cautioned .
26331901	Obama has made a practice of delivering campaign speeches to audiences that may not want to hear what he has to say as part of an effort to portray himself as an agent of change .
26331902	Obama recently told automakers in Detroit that they ought to build more fuel efficient vehicles and told unionized teachers they ought to embrace performance-based merit pay .
26331903	`` I am asking you to join me in ushering in a new era of mutual responsibility in America , '' Obama told his Wall Street audience .
26331904	ALAN KEYES GIVES ELECTED OFFICE ONE MORE TRY
26331905	Perennial gadfly candidate Alan Keyes is now the 10th candidate seeking the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 .
26331906	Keyes , who mounted unsuccessful efforts for the presidency in 1996 and 2000 and for the Senate from both Maryland and Illinois , announced on his Web site Monday that he had officially joined the race .
26331907	Keyes served as a State Department official in the Reagan administration .
26331908	Among Keyes ' past races was a loss by 43 percentage points to Democrat Barack Obama in the 2004 Senate race in Illinois .
26331909	Illinois Republicans had called upon Keyes to challenge Obama in the November election after the winner of the Republican primary , Jack Ryan , dropped out of the race in response to a scandal .
26331910	`` There is n't a standout '' in the 2008 race for the Republican nomination , Keyes told radio talk show host Janet Parshall .
26331911	`` I 'm like a lot of folks , who have just looked at it and been unmoved . ''
26331912	JOHN THE BAPTIST
26331913	Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , says he does n't know if his Baptist faith will help him do well in the predominantly Baptist state of South Carolina when Republicans hold their presidential primary on Jan. 19 .
26331914	`` I have no idea , '' McCain told reporters on Sunday .
26331915	`` I was a member of that church in 2000 and it did n't save me then . ''
26331916	McCain lost the hard-fought South Carolina presidential primary to then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush , setting the stage for additional campaign setbacks that drove McCain from the race for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination .
26331917	McCain is emphasizing ties to the Baptist church in his campaign in South Carolina .
26331918	McCain , who has long identified himself as an Episcopalian , called himself a Baptist on Sunday while speaking with reporters .
26331919	McCain said that he and his family have been members of the North Phoenix Baptist Church in Arizona for more than 15 years .
26331920	`` It 's well known because I 'm an active member of the church , '' McCain said .
26331921	The Associated Press asked McCain on Saturday how his Episcopal faith played a role in his campaign and his life .
26331922	McCain grew up as an Episcopalian and attended an Episcopal high school in Alexandria , Va. , before attending the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis , Md.
26331923	`` It plays a role in my life .
26331924	By the way , I 'm not Episcopalian .
26331925	I 'm Baptist , '' McCain said .
26331926	`` Do I advertise my faith ?
26331927	Do I talk about it all the time ?

26972887	Denver -- The Colorado Attorney General joined an antitrust lawsuit filed Monday to stop a merger by two of the nation 's largest meatpackers .
26972888	Consumers and cattle producers would be harmed by the proposed acquisition of National Beef Packing Co. by JBS S.A. , according to the suit filed by the Department of Justice and attorneys general of 13 states .
26972889	S ?
26972890	o Paulo , Brazil-based JBS owns the major meat-processing plant in Greeley that until recently operated under the name Swift & Co. .
26972891	The name has been changed to JBS USA Inc.
26972892	`` This merger has the potential to significantly increase the price of beef for Colorado families , and to alter the important role that cattle production plays in Colorado , '' Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said in a statement .
26972893	`` This industry is too vital to Colorado 's economy for the state to allow this anti- competitive conglomeration to take place . ''
26972894	JBS became the third-largest beef processor in the U.S. last year after purchasing Swift & Co. for $ 225 million .
26972895	In March , JBS said it planned to acquire Kansas City , Mo.-based National Beef for $ 560 million , which would make it the nation 's largest beef processor .
26972896	The lawsuit filed Monday does not seek to stop JBS ' proposed acquisition of another meatpacker , Smithfield Beef Group Inc. , the nation 's fifth-largest beef producer , for $ 565 million .
26972897	JBS USA 's Greeley-based chief executive officer , Wesley Batista , said he disagrees with the anti-competitive claims in the lawsuit .
26972898	`` This transaction is highly pro-competitive and will generate significant efficiencies and synergies that will benefit our cattle suppliers and our beef customers , '' he said .
26972899	`` We believe the government 's case is misplaced and we look forward to defending this matter in court . ''
