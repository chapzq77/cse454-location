2988621	but 15 year ago , McCain himself startle colleague by propose to cut off money for struggle and embattled U.S. force in another perilous place : Somalia .
2988622	on the 2008 campaign trail , McCain be see as a unyielding hawk .
2988623	but before he first presidential run in 2000 , he declare he would work with the Democratic Party to devise foreign policy .
2988624	and while he now describe himself as a `` foot soldier in the Reagan revolution , '' he infuriate republican as a freshman congressman in 1983 by try to thwart President Reagan 's deployment of troops in Lebanon .
2988625	now the presumptive GOP nominee for president , McCain have adopt a surprising diversity of view on foreign policy issue during he 25 year in Congress , a pattern that bring uncertainty to the path he would take if elect .
2988626	McCain , a ex-navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner of war who have build he campaign around he national security expertise , have advance view on Iraq and Iran that be tough and assertive and that seem to put he in the neoconservative camp .
2988627	yet , McCain have on many occasion resist call for use of U.S. troops .
2988628	even now , he adopt position that be closer to traditional , pragmatic republican than hawkish neocon .

2988636	when McCain reach the White House , Inman predict , `` there be go to be a lot of disappointment on the neoconservative side . ''
2988637	in form he view on national security , McCain have always rely on a large circle of outside adviser and a handful of trust aide .
2988638	but he have typically work out he own conclusion .
2988639	and , take as a whole , they seem quirky and a la carte , rather than grow from a single philosophy .
2988640	from he father , a admiral who serve in World War II , he have inherit the view that the United States must preserve its image of strength and greatness , not back down from lesser opponent .
2988641	at the same time , McCain 's belief have be color by he time as a Navy aviator , when he and he buddy become convinced that civilian leader in Washington , D.C. , be dangerously mishandle the Vietnam War .
2988642	even while he want to extend american authority , McCain as a lawmaker have regularly buck the republican establishment .
2988643	the Lebanon vote be a example .
2988644	in 1983 , as a House freshman , McCain vote against a bill to extend Reagan 's deployment of U.S. troops there .
2988645	Reagan want more time to strengthen the fragile lebanese government , but McCain worry that the american force be too small and that U.S. interest do not justify the risk .
2988646	in a similar vein , when Saddam Hussein invade Kuwait in 1990 , McCain initially want to limit the response to a air war .
2988647	`` to start put american troops into that kind of meat grinder I just do not think be a viable option , '' McCain say at the time .
2988648	but he quickly change he view , vote five month later to join a international effort to push Saddam out of Kuwait .
2988649	three year later , after 18 Army Rangers be kill in in Mogadishu , Somalia , McCain decide that it be time to withdraw the troops and he introduce a amendment to cut off fund .
2988650	he write later that he regret the step as a encroachment on the president 's power and `` as a retreat in the face of aggression from a inferior foe . ''
2988651	McCain oppose the U.S. military intervention in Haiti in 1993 .
2988652	like then-president Clinton , he be reluctant to intervene in Bosnia in 1993 and 1994 .
2988653	after the Dayton peace accord in 1995 , McCain support the administration 's plan to send U.S. peacekeeper into the region , with some reservation .
2988654	grow bolder in he advocacy of U.S. deployment , McCain in 1999 favored american force -- even ground troops -- to halt the `` ethnic cleanse '' of albanian in the yugoslavian province of Kosovo .
2988655	McCain be move closer to the muscular interventionism advance by analyst like William Kristol and Robert Kagan , friend and adviser generally consider neoconservative .
2988656	he begin give greater emphasis to the idea that the United States need to assert itself abroad to promote its value , not just narrow national interest .
2988657	`` he clearly be move closer to the neocon , '' say Simes .
2988658	by the time the 2000 election campaign get underway , `` they be already quite enthusiastic about he , '' Simes say .
2988659	yet McCain keep close tie among he old-school realist , include Kissinger , former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage .
2988660	they think he be on they side , too .
2988661	in 2002 , when debate erupt over war with Iraq , McCain seem to strengthen he identity as a neoconservative .
2988662	he agree with administration official that Saddamwas try to restart he nuclear weapon program , and he urge the United States to give more money to controversial financier Ahmad Chalabi of the iraqi National Congress and other iraqi exile .
2988663	he predict that regime change in Iraq could catalyze sweeping democratic change in the region .
2988664	McCain have stake out a more hawkish position on Iran than the Bush administration , say that , `` the only thing worse than military action against Iran be a nuclear-armed Iran . ''
2988665	but McCain have send conflict signal , as well .
2988666	in 1998 , he suggest to the Weekly Standard magazine that as president he would develop a consensus foreign policy , consult the `` best mind I know , '' include President Carter 's national security adviser , Zbigniew Brzezinski ; Clinton administration Secretary of State Warren Christopher ; President George H.W. Bush 's Secretary of State James A. Baker III , and Kissinger .
2988667	McCain have be tough on Russia , call for world power to eject the country from the g-8 group of industrial nation and disparage former President Vladimir Putin .
2988668	but he have take a pragmatic position on China , a country that do not follow U.S. human rights practice but be far more vital to its prosperity .
2988669	hawkish toward toward North Korea , McCain say in the mid-1990 that the United States should consider military action to stop Pyongyang 's nuclear program .
2988670	recently , however , he have tone down he comment .
2988671	McCain have support the idea of a `` League of Democracies , '' a coalition that might substitute for the United Nations and use military force .
2988672	critic view the idea as a dangerous neocon scheme that could alienate Russia , China and Saudi Arabia and further polarize the world .
2988673	at the same time , he have be generally positive about the role of the United Nations .
2988674	McCain have favor strengthen NATO and tie to european ally , and have spend time cultivate european leader .
2988675	Randy Scheunemann , McCain 's chief foreign policy adviser , reject the idea that McCain have move to a more neoconservative position in recent year , and , indeed , reject the term `` neoconservative '' as meaningless .
2988676	he say the difference on foreign policy among McCain 's supporter reflect not that he have take many view , but simply he wide appeal .
2988677	`` John McCain unite the republican foreign policy spectrum , '' say Scheunemann .
2988678	`` they be almost all supporter . ''

3405465	it may also have damage he carefully hone image as a family man , something he have reinforce over the year by appear with he family in campaign literature and -- until this week -- on the city 's web site .
3405466	and it be unclear how the political fallout will treat one of the region 's most recognizable figure .
3405467	the revelation also raise ethical question about Salinas ' decision to become involve with a politician she be cover as a journalist .
3405468	several media analyst condemn the relationship as a conflict for she and the mayor and suggest that Salinas ' boss should have take immediate action to remove she from handle any Villaraigosa coverage .

3405476	she do that .
3405477	and they agree . ''

3405482	she say she and she niece enter the lobby , where they encounter Villaraigosa , who be wear a dress shirt and slacks , and be carry bag of takeout food and a bottle of wine .
3405483	the two woman and Villaraigosa hop into the elevator .
3405484	he extend he hand to Rouda and introduce himself as `` Antonio . ''
3405485	`` I look at he and go , ` I know who you be .
3405486	I know who you be go to see .
3405487	tell she I say ` hi , ' '' she recall .
3405488	Rouda say she be certain that Villaraigosa be visit Salinas because everyone else in the 15-unit complex be `` older and jewish '' except for she .
3405489	`` I know he be not go to visit a elderly jewish woman with wine and food , '' she say .
3405490	Rouda , a self-described news junkie , say she recall the chance encounter because it be the night before the funeral of Rosa Parks in Detroit , which she see report on television and notice Villaraigosa have attend .
3405491	Rouda say she choose at the time not to tell anyone about meet the mayor because she think it be a private matter .
3405492	she speak only after Times reporter contact she recently .
3405493	Salinas subsequently move to another condo in Studio City .
3405494	in the meantime , Villaraigosa and Salinas also cross path professionally over the next year .
3405495	on March 20 , 2006 , Salinas travel to New York to cover Villaraigosa , who be visit Mayor Michael Bloomberg to discuss education reform .

3405504	`` he do come for service , '' say Eddie Lopez , the funeral home 's general manager .
3405505	`` I remember he be there . ''
3405506	all along , Villaraigosa and he aide remain silent about the relationship .
3405507	then in late January , rumor about the Villaraigosa 's shaky marriage pick up after a local internet blog report that the mayor and he wife have separate .
3405508	in a interview with the Times , Villaraigosa deny the report , which be fuel by the fact that he have stop wear he wedding ring , a point cite in the blog item .
3405509	aide say Villaraigosa , who have lose weight , stop wear the ring because it be slip off .
3405510	he be wear it during the interview .
3405511	the last time Villaraigosa speak publicly about he personal life be June 11 , when he hold a news conference to talk about the split with Corina Villaraigosa .
3405512	at the time , he would only say that he feel a `` personal sense of failure '' about the breakup and hope everyone would respect he family 's privacy .
3405513	the next day , she file for divorce .
3405514	but speculation continue to build about Salinas , whose name and picture appear on Internet blog , along with allegation that she be pregnant .
3405515	ask Tuesday whether Salinas be pregnant , Villaraigosa say : `` I can tell you emphatically that that question be outrageous and the answer be no , she be not pregnant . ''
3405516	Villaraigosa be not the first politician to be link to Salinas .
3405517	California Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez , D-Los Angeles , confirm in a recent interview that he date Salinas in 2003 when he be divorce from he wife ; the two have since remarry .
3405518	Nunez be a longtime Villaraigosa friend and political ally .
3405519	Salinas have work as a radio and television journalist in Los Angeles and Phoenix for more than 13 year , accord to she Telemundo biography .
3405520	she cover the `` political beat '' until she disclose she relationship with the mayor .
3405521	she duty be then expand to include general assignment story , work as a backup anchor and on the 11 p.m. news , accord to a statement from the station and company spokesman Alfredo Richard .
3405522	she have be fill in as the anchor on the 6 p.m. news for the last few month while the regular anchor , Lucia Navarro , be on maternity leave .
3405523	Salinas do not anchor the broadcast Tuesday night but do appear in file footage in Telemundo 's news report of she relationship with Villaraigosa .
3405524	on Tuesday , most member of the City Council either decline to comment on Villaraigosa 's confirmation or say that it be he own business .
3405525	Times staff writer Hector Bercerra , Anna Gorman and Sam Quinones and researcher John Tyrrell contribute to this report .
3521837	and he keep get better .
3521838	last season , the 7-year-old , 1,350-pound bull shave he time to 3.48 seconds ; this month , he trot out of Madison Square Garden in New York as the top - rank bull in the 2008 Versus Invitational , the opening event in bull ride 's major league .
3521839	but these day , with steroid scandal clouding many top sport , doubt waft like sawdust in the bullring too , and big buck find himself face a question about what make he a winner :
3521840	be it the mexican fighting bull in he , the Brahman influence , he Texas upbringing -- or something else ?
3521841	big buck have not duck the question -- instead submit to a needle-wielding veterinarian and make history in the process as the first buck bull to be test for anabolic steroid under the Professional Bull Riders ' new plan to keep the sport clean .
3521842	dog by internal rumbling that bull owner seek a advantage in the arena by inject the creature with steroid , the association recently decide it be time to ferret out the truth .
3521843	a number of people in the industry speculate that steroid be use on competitive bull in the past -lrb- at least one owner acknowledge have do so -rrb- but that the practice fall out of favor as owner realize they be trade short-term gain for long-term loss .
3521844	`` we sport have hang its hat along the line of true competition and honor and grit , '' say Matthew Rivela , general counsel for the professional Bull Riders Inc. , base in Pueblo .
3521845	`` we want to ensure the integrity of the sport . ''
3521846	although casual observer of rodeo understand that rider get point for stay on a bull , they might not know that the system work in the opposite direction too : Bulls get point for how high they kick and how tough a time they give the rider -- and fame and fortune come to owner of the animal that do it best .
3521847	bull owner can win bonus range from $ 1,250 to $ 20,000 for a world champion .
3521848	big buck , a past world champion , be a celebrity in he universe .
3521849	he owner say he be steroid-free and do not mind that he be the first to undergo testing -- they just do not want he to be unfairly single out .
3521850	test for steroid be become more common in horse racing , but it be virtually unheard of in the rodeo world .
3521851	neither the International Professional Rodeo Association nor the professional Rodeo Cowboys Association test animal , and they official say they have not hear of anyone else take the pbr 's approach .
3521852	it be a decision that will prompt some internal discussion , say Cindy Schonholtz , animal welfare coordinator for the professional Rodeo Cowboys Association in Colorado Springs , Colo.
3521853	despite they pursuit of testing , pbr official say they do not expect to find many , if any , problem .
3521854	steroid might not have be uncommon about a decade ago , they believe , but usage probably taper as owner realize the downside : sterility that render the bull useless as breeder .
3521855	`` I just do not think there be a lot of abuse out there , '' say Texas veterinarian Gary Warner , who work closely with pbr and help develop a bull steroid test .
3521856	although steroid could make a bull more aggressive -- possibly desirable in the arena -- they probably do not make he bigger , Warner say , primarily because once the steroid be inject , the bull can not be force to work out to build muscle .
3521857	even if the bull do bulk up , that be not a advantage in the ring , Warner say .
3521858	`` these guy have to express athleticism more like a dancer .
3521859	they be grade on how high they kick , how tight a circle they move in . ''
3521860	but good performer sometimes face accusation , he say .
3521861	`` that be where rumor mill get start , and management get catch in the middle , '' Warner say .
3521862	`` I know those cowboy , and they be awful good folk .
3521863	but who be to know ?
3521864	my hat 's off to pbr .
3521865	it will solve the problem of everyone point the finger . ''
3521866	as far as Texas bull owner Jerry Nelson be concern , steroid use be `` still a issue . ''
3521867	-lrb- begin optional trim -rrb-
3521868	`` you can tell by look at some of those bull and they size .
3521869	it be just like human being .
3521870	you can tell who be on it and who be not , '' he say .
3521871	a part-owner of big buck , he send hundred of bull to pbr competition .
3521872	`` to make the bull bigger , faster , meaner with a needle can make you more money , '' Nelson say .
3521873	-lrb- end optional trim -rrb-
3521874	a decade ago , he find himself with a couple of bull that would not put on weight , he say .
3521875	`` I could feed they like pig and they would not muscle up .
3521876	my vet suggest we could put they on steroid , '' he say .
3521877	so he do .
3521878	the drug make he bull bigger and meaner , Nelson say -- but they also render the animal sterile .
3521879	`` we quit -- it be not worth it , '' he say .
3521880	pbr official decide to implement the policy this year by test the top-performing bull at random event in the 2008 build Ford tough Series , its premier tour .
3521881	in the future they might conduct the random test on bull regardless of they performance , Rivela say .
3521882	he say the organization have not settle yet on the penalty for steroid user but do not intend to suspend violator this year .
3521883	Monetary fine be possible , Rivela say .
3521884	Nelson chafe at the idea that only winner , like he big buck , be scrutinize .
3521885	`` if they be go to test one bull , they need to test they all , '' he say .
3521886	that be not to say he be worried about big buck ' test result , which will not be available for another month .
3521887	he 'll be clean , Nelson say .
3521888	if he be not , Nelson say , he 'll be cry foul that someone tamper with he bull .
3521889	`` I be go to be like Roger Clemens on ` 60 Minutes , ' scream like hell , '' he say .
3795686	FORT MCMURRAY , Alberta
3795687	the Aurora Mine exude the odor of petroleum and the look of untapped riches .
3795688	the open pit mine plunge 250 foot deep and range over a couple of square mile , carve out of pine and spruce forest by gigantic machine that operate 24\/7 , even in the dark of winter at 40 degree below zero .
3795689	this be the heart of Alberta 's oil sand , a remote florida-sized region where moose , bear and beaver inhabit watery woodland atop the world 's largest proven petroleum reserve outside Saudi Arabia .
3795690	the unusual deposit -- where oil be lock in the tarry soil rather than pooled beneath the surface -- be yield a bonanza of investment dollar , government revenue and job .
3795691	almost half of Canada 's oil production come from the oil sand -- and the energy industry estimate that enough oil can be extract to fill the country 's need for three century .
3795692	the vast majority of canadian oil export go to the United States , and the Bush administration see the remain resource as America 's best hope for reduce dependence on Middle Eastern oil .
3795693	`` no single thing can do more to help we reach that goal than realize the potential of the oil sand , '' U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman say during a visit last July .
3795694	the benefit might be great , but the toll on other natural resource be also enormous .
3795695	separate petroleum from sand burn so much natural gas that the enterprise be become Canada 's largest source of greenhouse gas emission growth .
3795696	the oil sand lie within a major intact ecosystem , the boreal forest cover almost one-third of Canada 's land mass .
3795697	the forest be one of the world 's biggest freshwater storehouse and absorb a vast amount of carbon dioxide .
3795698	it also provide habitat for hundred of species of bird and be home to caribous , wolf and bear .
3795699	expansion of the oil sand operation could tear huge hole in a forest already rent by log , oil and gas exploration and other industry .
3795700	with development expect to triple , or even quintuple , in the next few decade , producer and government official puzzle over how to harness the oil sand ' potential with less cost to the climate , land , water and the well-being of native people who fear that cancer case in a downstream community might be a sign of lethal industrial pollution .
3795701	current lease for open-pit mining cover a area several time the size of New York City , accord to the Pembina Institute , a environmental research group in Alberta .
3795702	but more than 50,000 square mile be potentially available for various type of oil extraction , which have prompt environmentalist to call for stop development until ecological effect can be reduce .
3795703	`` the very nature of oil sand mean that develop they ... cause a incredible disruption to land and landscape over immense area , '' say a March report by the House of Commons natural resource committee .
3795704	although the U.S. be the primary market for the oil , pressure for development also come from chinese company that have be invest hundred of million of dollar in lease .
3795705	cavernous pit mine account for the bulk of the 1.2 million barrel of oil generate daily in a region with a estimate 174 billion barrel in reserve .
3795706	Syncrude Canada Ltd. , a joint venture that include Exxon Mobil Corp.-controlled Imperial Oil Resources , have 8,000 worker ; it spend $ 4.2 billion last year and have invest billion more in capital improvement .
3795707	`` it be not a business for the faint of heart , '' spokesman Alain Moore say .
3795708	at Syncrude 's Aurora Mine , dozen of electric shovel eat away at the tarry deposit .
3795709	with each scoop , the behemoth drop 100 ton of dirt into truck with bed as big as small house .
3795710	amid cloud of dust , the truck deliver they payload to machinery that crush and screen it before it be mix with hot water and pipe into a cone-shaped tank .
3795711	a form of petroleum call bitumen rise to the top , then be upgrade in a maze of smoke stack , pipe and steel structure as high as 23 story .
3795712	the leftovers be stockpile on the surround landscape .
3795713	huge yellow block of sulfur impurity be stack pyramid-fashion .
3795714	Dunes of sand expel from the plant sweep toward the horizon .
3795715	on lake-sized tailing pond , float scarecrow and fire from air cannon discourage bird from alight on the oily wastewater and die .
3795716	recover oil from sand require the use of natural gas to heat water , which produce greenhouse gas and other air pollutant .
3795717	the water itself be draw from the 765-mile-long Athabasca River , which flow from glacier in the canadian Rockies through numerous small community and sustain waterfowl , fish and other wildlife .
3795718	although improve technology and recycle have reduce the amount of water and energy need for each barrel of oil , Syncrude 's report show overall quantity grow along with oil production .
3795719	the oil sand operation account for 4 percent of Canada 's greenhouse gas emission in 2005 , and energy regulator say they have be increase .
3795720	University of Alberta ecologist David Schindler project that new development , couple with climate change , could cut the Athabasca River 's low winter flow in half or more by midcentury .
3795721	`` what they want to withdraw be a unsustainable amount , '' he say .
3795722	Alberta environmental official recently establish water-use rule to prevent biological damage to the river , and the provincial government have require a 12 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emission per barrel of oil .
3795723	but expert at the Pembina Institute maintain that those measure be inadequate .
3795724	the industry , which contribute billion of dollar in economic activity , royalty and tax each year , say it plan to minimize environmental effect through improve efficiency and through land restoration require by government lease .
3795725	Syncrude report that it have reclaim one-quarter of the land disturb by mining , although the government have not certify the land 's ability to sustain wildlife and plant .
3795726	Greg Stringham , vice president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers , say oil-sand operator be look at alternative to natural gas for heating water , include start controlled fire underground or use nuclear power .
3795727	some company , he say , be look at way to sequester carbon dioxide underground .
3795728	`` the government do not want to shut down the development because it provide benefit -lrb- to the country -rrb- and revenue to they , '' Stringham say .
3795729	`` all anyone can hope for be the best available technology , not just stop produce oil . ''
3795730	even people who claim harm from the fallout say the oil boom have its advantage .

4276166	one of Appalachia 's coal-mining giant agree Thursday to pay $ 20 million , the largest such fine impose by the Environmental Protection Agency , after a investigation find more than 4,500 instance in which mine runoff taint nearby water .
4276167	Massey Energy Co. , base in Richmond , Va. , also pledge to make about $ 10 million worth of upgrade to prevent such violation and to clean up a West Virginia stream ravage by mining-related pollution .
4276168	the term be mandate in a consent decree file Thursday in federal court in Charleston , W. Va.
4276169	the previous largest fine for violate federal clean water act permit , design to keep river and stream clean , be more than $ 12 million .
4276170	it be levy against Virginia 's Smithfield Foods in 1997 for contaminate waterway with hog waste .
4276171	the EPA sue Massey in May .
4276172	the agency say the penalty be trigger by the scale of Massey 's misconduct .
4276173	Robert Klepp , the lead EPA attorney in the case , say dirt , powdered coal and metal leak out of dozen of massey-owned site and into waterway in West Virginia and Kentucky for almost seven year .
4276174	`` this be a signal that , you know , EPA be on the job , '' Klepp say .
4276175	a years-long investigation have show that Massey neglect environmental safeguard , he say , add : `` they have other priority .
4276176	we think this agreement be go to refocus the priority . ''
4276177	Massey be among the top 10 coal company in the country , and it dominate in central Appalachia , a region that include Virginia , Kentucky and southern West Virginia .
4276178	Roger Hendriksen , a spokesman for Massey , say that the company 's violation be generally minor and that there have be no serious damage to the environment as a result .
4276179	but , he say , Massey agree to settle with the government because of the potential for a even more massive fine , which would have result have every violation earn the maximum punishment .
4276180	`` the perceive potential liability have become a concern for Massey shareholder , '' Hendriksen say .
4276181	only a fraction of the company 's environmental test show problem , he say .
4276182	`` I suppose one could say that we have not be perfect , but we be , again , in compliance .

4276191	Rainwater can carry out loose earth and coal residue as it flow from the site , and the mine can open pocket of underground water , which become polluted as it leak out .
4276192	in many instance , federal official say , Massey 's violation stem from a inability to corral this polluted water , which allow it to wash into stream untreated .
4276193	the improvement mandate in the decree include a new system that will provide fast result of water testing so that problem can be spotted quickly .
4276194	the company will also have to pay to clean the little Coal River , a stream in southwestern West Virginia that have be heavily affect by mine waste .
4276195	the $ 20 million fine will be pay into the U.S. Treasury 's general fund , Klepp say .
4276196	environmentalist in West Virginia and Washington applaud the fine yesterday and note other environmental damage cause by mountaintop-removal mine in that area .
4276197	`` we lose the fish , we bury the stream , '' say Cindy Rank of the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy .
4276198	`` it be like put the mountain through a Mixmaster , a blender kind of thing , and put it back . ''

17073037	the drooping value of the U.S. dollar mean canadian Christmas tree grower be see less green this season .
17073038	canadian Christmas tree grower have see they U.S. sale decline in recent year because of increase cost and competition from U.S. grower .
17073039	but it be they own currency that be cause they the most grief these day .
17073040	compare to the U.S. greenback , the canadian dollar be 15 percent higher in value than it be at the beginning of the year .
17073041	because grower be pay in U.S. dollar , they revenue be drop by the same amount .
17073042	canadian exporter of product range from seafood , lumber and auto part to canadian Club whiskey be all in the same boat .
17073043	but Christmas tree be a especially visible example at this time of year .
17073044	the situation be blame for drive Canada 's largest Christmas tree grower , Nova Scotia 's Kirk Forest Products , out of business .
17073045	`` that put the dagger to the heart , '' say the company 's founder , Rick Kirk , who be ship about 250,000 tree , most of they to the U.S. , in he company 's final holiday season .
17073046	`` we know that the market be go to be squeeze year after year . ''
17073047	more than half of Canada 's Christmas tree be ship to the U.S. , but the figure have drop by about 20 percent , to about 2 million tree , since 2002 .
17073048	during that period , the value of the canadian dollar grow by about 50 percent .
17073049	the effect on U.S. consumer be minimal because canadian tree account for less than 10 percent of the total number of tree sell .
17073050	this season , the average purchase price for a live Christmas tree in the U.S. be expect to be similar to last year 's average of $ 40.50 -lrb- euro27 .65 -rrb- , say Rick Dungey of the National Christmas Tree Association in Chesterfield , Missouri .
17073051	while the exchange rate be bad for canadian exporter , it be a boon for U.S. retailer because Canadians be flock across the border this month to shop .
17073052	all probably think they have see the peak last summer when the canadian dollar -- call the loonie -- reach a 28-year high against the greenback .
17073053	but the loonie 's value have continue to grow , reach level not see since the U.S. Civil War 140 year ago , say Michael Woolfolk , senior currency strategist with the Bank of New York Mellon Corp. in New York .
17073054	the canadian dollar surge to a all - time high of $ 1.10 against the greenback in November , a gain of 28 percent from Jan. 1 , before fall back a bit .
17073055	in dollar and cent , a canadian grower who receive us$ 20 -lrb- euro13 .65 -rrb- for a tree would have pocket $ 23.30 Canadian last December .
17073056	this month , the same us$ 20 per tree translate to about $ 20.20 Canadian , a drop of about $ 3 .
17073057	`` it erase we profit , or very close , '' say Larry Downey of Cookshire-Eaton , Quebec , president of the canadian Christmas Tree Association .
17073058	the problem for canadian Christmas tree grower begin in 2002 , about the same time the canadian dollar begin rise in value .
17073059	since then , canadian tree export to the U.S. have decline about 20 percent to 2.1 million tree last year .
17073060	some canadian grower have protect themselves to some degree by enter into future contract that be base on currency .
17073061	for the rest , the only other choice be to ride it out and hope for better time or get out .
17073062	though Kirk be get out , many canadian grower be stay in hope of negotiate better contract next year , say Tom Ernst , another Christmas tree grower in Mahone Bay , Nova Scotia .
17073063	Ernst export only 30 percent of he tree , so he be hurt less than other who sell a greater percentage of they tree abroad .
17073064	`` we be not put all of we egg in one basket , '' he say .
17073065	`` that be part of the idea behind it . ''
17073066	Higgins Family Christmas Trees also be stick it out even though the company -- also in Nova Scotia -- export all of its tree .
17073067	Forrest Higgins say the company plan to ship about 30,000 tree this season to Maine and down the East Coast .
17073068	`` we have be in business a long time and you have to accept that there be real strong year when there be a lot of money to be make , '' Higgins say .
17073069	`` you take those year when it be profitable in stride with those year when it be tough . ''
17073070	base on this season , however , canadian grower can expect spirited competition when they start negotiate for Christmas 2008 .
17073071	Phil Roberts , owner of Broadway Gardens in South Portland , Maine , say he may have to switch to locally grow tree , even if some canadian supplier have a edge on quality .
17073072	he tree price be go up and he can not pass on all the increase to this customer .
17073073	Roberts be already pay $ 3 -lrb- euro2 .05 -rrb- to $ 4 -lrb- euro2 .73 -rrb- more per tree from Quebec Province than last season .
17073074	that be because grower raise they price over the summer in anticipation of the strong loonie .
17073075	`` they be at a point where they be higher than the Maine tree , '' Roberts say .
17073076	`` I 'll definitely be look at Maine tree next year . ''

22366199	perhaps no event in baseball history have better epitomize the Yogi Berra adage `` it be like deja vu all over again '' than the untimely end of the Mets ' 2008 season .
22366200	just as in 2007 , the team cough up a September lead in the standing and fall one game out of a playoff spot with two to play .
22366201	just as in 2007 , a inspired pitching performance against Florida in the penultimate game of the year lift the Mets back into a tie .
22366202	and just as in 2007 , they wilt on the season 's final Sunday while they rival triumph .
22366203	thus begin the latest edition of the Mets ' winter blame game , a tradition that be sadly become as reliable a Queens fixture as the plane landing at La Guardia .
22366204	fan often tend to hold star accountable when they team fall short , reasoning that the player earn the big buck should shoulder the responsibility for the club 's failing .
22366205	but the story of the 2008 Mets be not one of marquee player fail to live up to they billing .
22366206	instead , it be the soft underbelly of the roster that be painfully and repeatedly expose during the season .
22366207	in a tight race like this one , a few warm body would have make all the difference .
22366208	after last year 's momentous collapse , general manager Omar Minaya convinced fan that 2008 would be different by outmaneuver a crowded field of suitor for Johan Santana , the game 's best pitcher for the previous five year .
22366209	the 2007 club miss the postseason by a single game ; with the addition of Santana , a playoff spot seem a foregone conclusion .
22366210	Santana do not disappoint , lead the National League in inning and earn run average .
22366211	yet the Mets win just one more game with Santana than they do the previous year without he .
22366212	what happen to the rest of the team , cause Santana 's masterful pitch to be squander ?
22366213	the rest of the Mets ' core actually exceed the high expectation set for they .
22366214	David Wright and Carlos Beltran would be strong contender for most valuable player have the team make the playoff .
22366215	Wright 's .390 on-base percentage and .534 slug percentage be second among NL third baseman , and Beltran 's mark of .376 and .500 be top among the league 's full-time center fielder .
22366216	Jose Reyes increase he slugging percentage by more than 50 point from 2007 and remain a potent threat on the basis with 56 steal ; only Hanley Ramirez of Florida be a superior shortstop in the NL .
22366217	Carlos Delgado enjoy a nice comeback season at first base , finish third in the league with 38 home run .
22366218	with so many outstanding performance , the Mets should have waltz into the playoff .
22366219	but those effort be negate by unfathomably poor showing from the back of the roster .
22366220	where the Mets do not have a star , they do not have a prayer .
22366221	second base be a sinkhole : Luis Castillo , who snooker Minaya for a $ 25 million deal last November , produce a .305 slugging percentage .
22366222	injury to Ryan Church and Moises Alou leave the outfield corner in tatters , force the Mets to hand 270 at-bat to the defensive specialist Endy Chavez -lrb- .330 slugging percentage -rrb- .
22366223	the back of the rotation prove disastrous , as Pedro Martinez compile a 5.61 era , and a parade of rookie and journeyman take similar lump when he and John Maine be on the disabled list .
22366224	finally , the bullpen be nothing short of horrifying , ranking 13th in the league in era and blow 29 of the 72 save opportunity .
22366225	the hardest part of assemble a playoff-caliber team be acquire the star , a task the Mets have perform admirably .
22366226	but if there be a broad lesson to be learn from the 2008 Mets , it be the intrinsic limit to the impact a single player can make on a baseball team .
22366227	in basketball and football , coach can funnel the ball to they star as much as they wish .
22366228	but all position player in baseball must wait they turn to bat , and physiology put a ceiling on the number of inning a pitcher can throw .
22366229	as a result , great baseball player be much less able to compensate for weak teammate than they counterpart in other sport .
22366230	invest in the back of the roster to ensure nearly league - average performance across the board do not generate headline , but it be critical to build a successful team .
22366231	although Minaya have make a number of dramatic acquisition , he have fail miserably to minimize he club 's vulnerability .
22366232	injury to he aging veteran be inevitable , and Minaya could have easily bolster the Mets ' depth on the free-agent market .
22366233	Outfielder Milton Bradley -lrb- who lead the American League in on-base percentage -rrb- and starter Kyle Lohse -lrb- who win 15 game -rrb- be available for one-year deal in the $ 4 million to $ 5 million range .
22366234	once the team 's weakness become clear , Minaya could have trade for Seattle 's Raul Ibanez , or San Francisco 's Ray Durham -- or sign Barry bond , who be available for the minimum salary .
22366235	but Minaya seem confident that the team 's star would carry the club to the postseason .
22366236	now he will have a unexpectedly long off-season to reflect on he mistake .

22791137	quality gain have dealer in a bind
22791138	with less warranty work , Ford be try to increase aftermarket part sale and service .
22791139	by Bryce G. Hoffman
22791140	the Detroit News
22791141	Ford Motor Co. be improve the quality of its car and truck but , in a ironic twist , the gain come at a price for dealer who have come to depend on regular warranty work to keep they store in the black .
22791142	dealer know that have better vehicle will help they in the long run , but they be look to the automaker for help develop other part of they business to offset the loss in warranty business .
22791143	this week , Ford deliver with several new program .
22791144	`` we be work on give they the tool to improve they retail part and service business , '' Ford Americas President Mark Fields tell the News .
22791145	`` we need we dealer partner to be successful .
22791146	but the real benefit to the dealer be that , as we continue to improve we quality , we be go to get more people into the showroom and we be go to sell more car . ''
22791147	in the meantime , Ford be expand its aftermarket replacement part and accessory business to help dealer .
22791148	as they gather for they annual conference in Las Vegas this week , Ford unveil a new brand call `` Customs '' that will offer everything from bug - shield to bed-liner for Ford vehicle .
22791149	the focus will be on high-profit item like custom wheel and electronics , say Jay Davis , general marketing manager for Ford 's customer service division .
22791150	he say Ford will also give dealer e-commerce tool to build they customization business online .
22791151	`` as the market move , we need to move with they , '' Davis say .
22791152	`` all of these thing help build owner loyalty . ''
22791153	dealer profit on warranty work
22791154	General Motors Corp. be see some decline in warranty work at its U.S. dealership and also be work to expand dealer ' retail service business .
22791155	Chrysler LLC say it be not a major issue .
22791156	expert say that if Ford be sell more vehicle , the decline in warranty business would be less of a issue .
22791157	but Ford 's U.S. market share have be decline since the mid-1990 .
22791158	Paul Taylor , chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association , say dealer lose a average of $ 30 on each new car and truck they sell and make it up in other part of they business , such as financing and service .
22791159	but loss be much greater for the typical U.S. brand dealer than for the typical asian brand dealer .
22791160	that mean domestic brand dealer need to make more money off thing like warranty work .
22791161	but warranty work generate just under $ 7.7 billion for U.S. dealer last year , Taylor say , a 2 percent decline over 2006 .
22791162	Ford , which have have the strongest quality gain of any of the domestic automaker , see its warranty business decline by 12 percent nationwide during the same period , after a similar drop between 2005 and 2006 .
22791163	`` it be something I hear about from dealer , '' say Curt Yun , director of global warranty analysis at Ford , who say the automaker 's warranty cost drop $ 1 billion last year worldwide .
22791164	`` that be more money for we to invest back into the business , back into new product . ''
22791165	Dave Knittel know the problem all too well .
22791166	thing be quiet these day in the service bay at Charlotte County Lincoln Mercury in Florida , where he be the general manager .
22791167	a little too quiet .
22791168	`` Ford 's car do not break down anymore , '' Knittel sigh .
22791169	`` you do not see the amount of warranty work we use to . ''
22791170	in 2001 , Knittel 's store do $ 400,000 in warranty work .
22791171	by 2006 , that figure have drop to $ 93,000 .
22791172	and last year look to have be even lower .
22791173	Knittel remember a time when he do as much as $ 100,000 in warranty work in a month .
22791174	Ford and Lincoln Mercury dealer across the country be report decline that , if not as steep as Knittel 's , nonetheless represent a substantial blow to they bottom line .
22791175	Michael Kennedy , who own four Ford store in the greater philadelphium area , know that Ford 's improve quality be good news for he business in the long run .
22791176	but he still have to deal with a 40 percent decline in warranty business over the past two year .
22791177	`` it be a double-edged sword , '' he say .
22791178	`` financially , it hurt a little bit .
22791179	and it could push some of the smaller dealer over the edge .
22791180	but it also mean we be go to do more repeat business . ''
22791181	Kennedy also own a Chevrolet franchise .
22791182	warranty work be down there , too , he say , but not to the same degree it be at he Ford store .
22791183	less recall mean less service work
22791184	Professor Jeff Bennett of Northwood University in Midland , a expert in the retail auto market , say nearly every manufacturer be see some decline in warranty cost because quality be improve across the board .
22791185	he say recall be down dramatically since 1999 , when nearly 20 million car and truck be recall in the United States -- 3 million more than be sell that year .
22791186	that may have be good news for service writer , but it be a major contributor to the decline in U.S. brand like Ford , once know for they quality .
22791187	`` it use to be that dealer look at they service department as a necessary evil , '' Bennett say .
22791188	`` it be not a profit center . ''
22791189	that begin change in the late 1970 when car become increasingly computerized .
22791190	at the same time , U.S. manufacturer begin heap big discount on they product to compete with newcomer from Japan .
22791191	that undercut dealer profit from new car sale , force they to rely more on they warranty business .
22791192	Ford be try to help its dealer change the equation again by beef up they retail part and service business .
22791193	it begin a couple of year ago by offer to help dealer set up `` Quick Lane '' service bay to handle routine maintenance like oil change .
22791194	earlier this year , Ford begin roll out a new reward program call `` Owner Advantage '' that offer customer incentive to take they vehicle to they dealership for such routine work .
22791195	in addition to marketing support , Ford will be mail customer credit card pre-loaded with $ 10 that they can use for thing like tune-up at they dealership .
22791196	many of these change be be push by Jim Farley , Ford 's new global chief of marketing , sale and service .
22791197	he know how important the retail part and service business can be to dealer from he day as a Toyota Motor Corp. executive , NADA 's Taylor say .
22791198	the aftermarket part business be worth more than $ 45 billion annually , and Toyota be one of the leader .
22791199	`` Ford 's focus on it have not be as comprehensive as Toyota 's , '' Taylor say .
22791200	`` that certainly be a opportunity not to be miss . ''

23165982	JOHANNESBURG , South Africa
23165983	the govern party in oil-rich Angola win a landslide victory in the country 's first election in 16 year , official result release Tuesday show , prompt a remarkable concession of defeat by the lead opposition party , which just six year ago be the government 's enemy in a brutal 27-year civil war .
23165984	the decisive win for the govern Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola , know as the MPLA , in last week 's legislative election will give it the two-third majority in parliament need to change the constitution and further entrench its dominance of angolan politics , senior official in both party say Tuesday .
23165985	it will also confer a measure of legitimacy on a government that have be in power since Angola gain its independence from Portugal in 1975 .
23165986	while american and european election observer conclude that the political playing field be hardly level give the MPLA 's control of state media , they also say the election itself be evidence of democratic progress .
23165987	`` again , we congratulate the people of Angola on they participation in this important step in strengthen they democracy , '' the U.S. Embassy 's election observation team say in a statement on Tuesday .
23165988	the tranquillity that prevail as million of Angolans go to the poll last week and the acceptance of the outcome by the opposition party , the National Union for the total independence of Angola , or UNITA , set this election apart from Angola 's calamitous last vote , in 1992 .
23165989	at that time , UNITA 's guerrilla leader , Jonas Savimbi , refuse to accept he second-place finish and the civil war that have already kill hundred of thousand of people resume for another decade , end only when Savimbi be kill in a firefight in 2002 .
23165990	shadow by that woeful history , UNITA accept its defeat this time despite what observer say be flaw in the voting process in Luanda , the capital .
23165991	`` we do not want to create a situation where this drag on for week and week , '' Jardo Muekalia , UNITA 's representative for electoral issue , say in a interview on Tuesday .
23165992	`` we want to make sure for peace and stability 's sake we end this on a high note . ''
23165993	the official tally , post Tuesday on the election commission 's web site , show the mplum with about 82 percent of the vote to UNITA 's 10 percent , with more than 80 percent of the vote count .
23165994	the rest of the vote be divide among a dozen other party and coalition .
23165995	official in both the main party agree the MPLA would have a two-third legislative majority .
23165996	the European Union 's election observer mission find that Angola 's election fall short of international standard because the state-controlled radio , television and daily newspaper be bias in favor of the government and because of flaw in some election procedure .
23165997	Voter list be distribute too late to be post in most area , make it impossible to check who have vote , though the use of indelible ink on voter ' finger help guard against double voting , the EU mission find .
23165998	there be also widespread delay in the opening of many polling place in Luanda and a failure to deliver sufficient ballot to they .
23165999	the election authority also do not accredit hundred of trained election observer in Luanda , the mission say .
23166000	still , the EU 's report say , the election have be peaceful and show the angolan people 's `` clear commitment to the country 's democratic process and desire to leave behind a past mark by decade of war and civil conflict . ''
23166001	the MPLA 's margin of victory leave UNITA even more marginalize -- a situation that some analyst worry could weaken the much - need development of a effective political opposition .
23166002	the public money each party receive be base on its number of parliament seat , and UNITA will have fewer now .
23166003	it could regain a foothold if the government follow through on plan to hold local election in a couple of year .
23166004	even with this election win , Angola 's govern elite will still be stick with a reputation for self-dealing and corruption that show up in study by Transparency International and the World Bank Institute .
23166005	`` there be a risk they will become more arrogant , '' say Indira Campos , a researcher for Chatham House , a London policy research organization .
23166006	or as Isabel Emerson , Angola country director for the National Democratic Institute , a washington-based nonprofit group , say : `` the fact that they win such a vast majority will translate into a one party state practically .
23166007	I hope they see it as a wake-up call . ''
23166008	Manuel Fragata de Morais , the MPLA 's information secretary in Luanda , say Tuesday that the party feel the weight on its shoulder .
23166009	`` if Angola 's a one-party state , it would be for the first time by popular vote , '' he exclaim .
23166010	`` so we be not worry by that .
23166011	but seriously , we have to be very humble , serene and serious or otherwise we could pay seriously in public support . ''
23193453	MANCHESTER , N.H.
23193454	at the Merrimack Restaurant on Elm Street , where a mural of past presidential candidate adorn the red brick facade , Maria Saitas be worry .
23193455	not only will New Hampshire 's primary be over earlier than ever next year , but the window between the Iowa and New Hampshire contest -- a mere five day in early January -- will be wincingly brief .
23193456	`` we 'll absolutely lose money , '' say Saitas , who buy the restaurant with she sister in 1981 and have welcome virtually every major presidential candidate since then .
23193457	`` the more time they spend here , the better off we be . ''
23193458	she be among many New Hampshire resident grumble about the circumstance that lead they state to schedule its primary for Jan. 8 , a decision mean to protect its influential role in the presidential race as dozen of other state move up they nominating contest .
23193459	restaurant and hotel be anticipate less business , but some state official and resident fear worse : that the short interval after the Iowa caucus on Jan. 3 will mean less attention from the candidate and insufficient time to mull Iowa 's result before cast they own vote .
23193460	`` I wish we could go back to the '70 , when there be a full month between the two state , '' say Raymond Buckley , chairman of the state Democratic Party .
23193461	`` with all the candidate try to divide they time between the two state , they be waste a inordinate amount of money and jet fuel and maybe not really get to know the community . ''
23193462	but William M. Gardner , New Hampshire 's longtime secretary of state , say pride should remain the dominant emotion here , despite the compress schedule .
23193463	Gardner point to a study by the University of New Hampshire in 2000 that show that a primary here have a smaller economic impact than a single weekend of NASCAR race at the New Hampshire International Speedway in Loudon .
23193464	`` this primary be never about the money for we , '' say Gardner , who settle on Jan. 8 last week after Michigan 's primary be set for Jan. 15 .
23193465	`` there be a reason we have it , but it be not economics or fame . ''
23193466	under state law , New Hampshire must hold its primary at least seven day before any `` similar election , '' a tradition Gardner call crucial for the nation as a whole .
23193467	-lrb- Iowa 's caucus can come earlier because they be different from the primary process . -rrb-
23193468	`` we law only say that whatever happen here , there need to be time for the rest of the nation to reflect afterward , '' say Gardner , a Democrat .
23193469	`` that be what be important . ''
23193470	the New Hampshire and Michigan primary will be follow by contest in Nevada , South Carolina and Florida by month 's end .
23193471	more than 20 state have schedule they contest for Feb. 5 , the earliest date allow by the party without special exception .
23193472	at the Wayfarer Inn in Bedford , where news media outlet from around the world have book room and pay impressive bar and restaurant tab in past primary season , a manager say CBS and Time magazine have book all 175 of its room at $ 249 apiece for a week in early January .
23193473	but the manager , Ian Braziller , say reporter use to stay at least three day longer .
23193474	make matter worse , the Wayfarer have to turn down request from wedding party and other group seek room in January while it wait for Gardner to choose a primary date .
23193475	it be worth it , Braziller say -- in election year , the hotel get more than 10 percent of its business from the lead-up to the primary -- but still nerve-racking .
23193476	`` we be stick in limbo for month , '' Braziller say , `` and it be really tough . ''
23193477	other find a bright side , say the candidate begin visit much earlier than usual because it be clear that New Hampshire 's primary would come unusually early .
23193478	`` it start so early this year that we have picture of some of the candidate wear shorts , '' say Paul Manuel , executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College in Manchester .
23193479	`` in the past , we have only see they in parka . ''
23193480	Andrew E. Smith , director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center , say most of the state do not reap any economic benefit from primary season , because the population , and hence campaign event , be concentrate in the southeast corner .
23193481	one television station , WMUR in Manchester , get a lot of advertising revenue , Smith say -- include so much from Steve Forbes , a republican candidate in 1996 and 2000 , that the station build a new wing know locally as `` The House that Forbes build . ''
23193482	`` but the perception that there be a tremendous amount of money come into the state be just not accurate , '' Smith say .
23193483	on the other hand , he say , the briefer window between the Iowa and New Hampshire contest could hurt candidate who lose a tight race in Iowa .
23193484	`` if a Clinton or a Romney get beat in Iowa and be bank on New Hampshire as a firewall state , '' Smith say , `` it give they campaign less time to come back . ''
23193485	but Manuel say New Hampshire voter be too independent to be sway by what happen in Iowa , even if they have less time to make they own decision .
23193486	he point to a beloved phrase here : `` in Iowa they pick corn ; in New Hampshire they pick president . ''
23193487	`` if that theory hold up , certainly it will not matter if it be one day , five day or 100 '' between the contest , he say .
23193488	`` then again , we have not be here before .
23193489	it be go to be interesting to find out . ''
23563331	smaller business in Massachusetts would pay lower tax , but large out-of-state company with operation in the Bay State would pay more under change to the state 's tax code move through Beacon Hill , revenue specialist say .
23563332	the House of Representatives last week approve Governor Deval Patrick 's proposal to change the way Massachusetts calculate business tax liability , particularly for those company that have operation in multiple location .
23563333	currently corporation pay tax only on the income earn by they Massachusetts unit .
23563334	this method have spawn a industry of tax scheme for company to minimize liability by divide profit and loss strategically among various unit .
23563335	the new mechanism would use what be know as `` combined reporting , '' in which a company 's profit be tax accord to a formulum that consider its sale , payroll , and capital asset in the state .
23563336	twenty-one state have adopt a form of combined report to deter tax avoidance among company .
23563337	the Massachusetts proposal now go before the state Senate .
23563338	a spokesman for Senate President Therese Murray say she have not yet disclose a proposal on corporate tax .
23563339	the Patrick administration estimate a change to combined reporting would raise a additional $ 188 million in revenue next year .
23563340	but opponent say that with the economy slowing , now be a bad time for any tax increase on large company that sustain huge number of job .
23563341	`` I can not define a exact group who will be impact , but what I do know be the weight of this will fall most heavily on large , multistate corporation that employ hundred of thousand of Massachusetts citizen , '' say Michael Widmer , president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation , a nonprofit business advocacy group .
23563342	another business leader , Alan G. Macdonald of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable , cite Procter & Gamble , the Ohio consumer product giant that buy Gillette Co. in 2005 , as the type of company that would face a much higher tax bill on , for example , asset such as its razor-making plant in South Boston .
23563343	a P&G spokeswoman say the company would not talk about specific tax payment but say the company support the position of group , include the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce , which have call for lower Massachusetts corporate tax rate .
23563344	meanwhile , the new method could result in lower tax for small - to-midsize company that have most or all of they operation here in Massachusetts .
23563345	`` more often than not , the company base here who have no operation outside the state be the winner , '' say Tarra Curran , principal of Tofias PC , a accounting and tax firm in Cambridge .
23563346	for example , she say a local company with several hundred million dollar in revenue that currently pay million in tax may see its annual tax bill reduce around one hundred thousand dollar or more .
23563347	Macdonald add that only a few small company in he membership say they would benefit from the tax change .
23563348	chiefly the executive in he group be worry the new measure will make they tax return more complicated .
23563349	`` they be split , but mostly they be not happy because of the extra level of complexity '' and more payment , he say .
23563350	to minimize what would be a large tax increase , the legislation would lower the overall tax rate charge to corporation from the current 9.5 percent .
23563351	the measure pass by the House , for example , would reduce rate to as low as 7.5 percent by 2011 depend on revenue growth .
23563352	the Taxpayers Foundation have previously say it would support combined report only if it be tie to reduction in the corporate tax rate to make the legislation revenue neutral , probably to around 7 percent .
23563353	but the original version push by the governor , and the one pass by the House , have rate that be not low enough to offset the higher collection company would have to pay .

24433082	Wall Street 's big bet on risky mortgage may be souring a lot faster than have be previously think .
24433083	the once booming market for home loan to people with weak credit -- know as subprime mortgage and make largely to minority , the poor and first-time buyer stretch to afford a home -- be come under greater pressure .
24433084	the evidence can be see in rise default rate , increasingly strained finances at mortgage lender and grow doubt among investor .
24433085	now , Wall Street firm , which have help fuel the growth in the market by bankroll and invest in subprime mortgage lender , have begin to pinch off the money spigot .
24433086	several mortgage lender have recently collapse .
24433087	while the failure so far be small in number , some industry official be concern that they could be the first in a wave .
24433088	the subprime sector , which produce loan worth more than $ 500 billion in the first nine month of last year , could shrink significantly .
24433089	a sharp contraction in subprime mortgage would have ripple effect , reduce consumer ' access to credit and affect investor like foreign central bank , pension and mutual fund that have be big buyer of mortgage-backed security .
24433090	the recent bankruptcy of Ownit Mortgage Solutions , a lender base in Agoura Hills , Calif. , provide a cautionary tale .
24433091	even as its revenue grow by more than a third in the first nine month of 2006 , to $ 8.3 billion , the company be lose money .
24433092	it shut down after its financial backer , which include Merrill Lynch & Co. and JPMorgan Chase , could not come up with a deal to save it .
24433093	in addition to Ownit , Sebring Capital Partners , base outside Dallas , close in December , and mortgage Lenders Network of Middletown , Conn. , have stop make loan through broker , lay off more than 800 employee and be be investigate by state regulator .
24433094	`` pick a company -- small , medium or large -- they all have the same problem : Capital , '' say Marc A. Geredes , who run a small mortgage company , LownHome Financial , in San Jose , Calif. `` the economics of the business do not make sense right now . ''
24433095	Wall Street firm be attract to such lender because they help feed a pipeline of security back by the mortgage , a market bigger than the one for U.S. Treasury bond and note .
24433096	Merrill Lynch , for example , securitize $ 67.8 billion in residential mortgage in the first nine month of 2006 , up 58.4 percent from the period a year earlier .
24433097	but a increase number of borrower be default on subprime loan earlier now than they do a year ago , often within six month of have take the loan out , shake Wall Street 's confidence in its subprime partner .
24433098	in one indication that investor be lose they taste for mortgage , hedge fund that specialize in mortgage-backed security have a outflow of $ 1.8 billion in 2006 , down from a inflow of $ 1.8 billion in 2005 , accord to Hedge Fund Research .

24433101	while Wall Street 's tolerance for mortgage risk have wane , it be still interested in mortgage originator .
24433102	this week , Citigroup buy a mortgage servicing business from ABN Amro Holding for undisclosed term , and Barclays Bank buy the Equifirst Corp. , a subprime lender , for $ 225 million .
24433103	but something of a shakeout have begin .
24433104	`` the pendulum swing too far the other way , '' say Guy D. Cecala , president of Inside Mortgage Finance , which publish datum and newsletter on the industry .
24433105	`` at some point , it come back .
24433106	but what it usually take be a little blood on the road . ''
24433107	if that be indeed how the story will play out , William D. Dallas , the founder and chief executive of Ownit , would argue that he company have become a early case of road kill .
24433108	in mid-November , JPMorgan Chase , which provide Ownit with money to make home loan , notify the company it be in default and would lose access to a $ 500 million credit line by Dec. 13 because it be lose money , have take on too much debt and its net worth have fall , accord to bankruptcy document and people brief on the company 's finances .
24433109	mortgage lender as small as Ownit and as big as Wells Fargo sit in the middle of housing 's food chain that start with individual home buyer and can end with investor in exotic credit derivative on the other side of the world .
24433110	smaller lender like Ownit use money provide by bank like jpmorgan and Merrill Lynch to make loan that it receive from mortgage broker who interact with and help fill in the paperwork for people buy home or refinance exist loan .
24433111	once complete , the mortgage be sell to Wall Street bank that package hundred of loan at a time into bond that be sell to investor and trade in financial market .
24433112	the bond be slice into different layer of risk and many investor typically accept lower return in exchange for guarantee that they will be pay ahead of people in the lower - quality portion of the security if borrower default on mortgage .
24433113	investor also shield themselves by require mortgage company like Ownit to buy back mortgage that incur `` early payment default , '' a industry term for loan that have turn bad quickly .
24433114	in recent month , bank have seek the safety of these protective measure and grow pickier about the kind of loan they will buy after notice that a grow number of borrower who take out loan in 2006 be fall behind on payment just a few month after they have be issue .
24433115	accord to its bankruptcy filing , Ownit be ask to buy back $ 166.4 million in loan , $ 93 million of which be owe to Merrill Lynch .
24433116	Merrill Lynch own about 20 percent of Ownit and provide a credit line worth billion of dollar to the company .
24433117	-lrb- also in December , Merrill Lynch buy First Franklin Financial , a subprime lender co-found by Dallas , for $ 1.3 billion from National City . -rrb-
24433118	Ownit 's strained financial circumstance set the tone for negotiation with jpmorgan , Merrill Lynch and CIVC Partners , a chicago-based private equity firm that own the majority of Ownit .
24433119	Dallas , who along with other executive own about 20 percent of the company , say Merrill Lynch agree to step in to make up Ownit 's financial shortfall and be even willing to buy the 80 percent of the company it do not already own .
24433120	but Dallas say the deal fall part on Dec. 7 , when Merrill pull its offer of additional fund and its representative on Ownit 's board , Michael Blum , tender he resignation by fax .
24433121	Blum , a manage director who head structure finance at Merrill Lynch , decline to comment through a spokesman .
24433122	`` while it be unfortunate that Ownit close its door , we meet every contractual obligation we have to they , '' William Halldin , the spokesman for Merrill Lynch , say .
24433123	`` like its majority owner , we do not think it be in the best interest of we shareholder to make a further investment . ''
24433124	the representative of CIVC Partners on the board of Ownit , Daniel Helle , do not return call .
24433125	for comment .
24433126	official at jpmorgan decline to discuss the negotiation .
24433127	-lrb- story can end here .
24433128	optional material follow . -rrb-
24433129	Dallas acknowledge that Ownit , like other subprime lender , see a sharp increase in default from new borrower in 2006 , compare with 2005 and 2004 -- year when few loan show early loss .
24433130	but he say the default be still low at 2 percent and insist that most of those borrower have simply miss one or two payment because they be confuse about where they should mail payment because many of they have two mortgage on they home .
24433131	across the industry , 2.6 percent of the subprime loan securitize in the second quarter of 2006 have be foreclose on , or have be repossessed within six month , up from 1 percent for loan securitize in the second quarter of 2005 , accord to Moody 's Investors Service , the rating agency .
24433132	Joseph Rocco , a analyst with Moody 's , note that foreclosure rate typically rise as loan get older .
24433133	the grim statistics reflect the sharp slowdown in housing .
24433134	home price , for instance , in many previously hot market on the coast and in the Southwest be fall as sale have slacken make it harder for homeowner in a financial bind to sell they property .
24433135	they also indicate that mortgage lender become more generous with 100 percent financing on home and allow borrower to state they income with little or no support documentation last year in a effort to bolster mortgage volume , accord to industry expert .
24433136	Banking regulator have increasingly voice concern about the loosening of lending practice by subprime lender and late last year demand that borrower be more closely vet before be qualify for adjustable-rate and other risky loan .
24433137	yet , housing advocate and industry expert say policy maker be also worry that too sharp a pullback in lending by Wall Street and commercial bank could cut off consumer access to credit .
24433138	for he part , Dallas acknowledge that standard be lower but he place the blame at the foot of investor and Wall Street , say they encourage Ownit and other subprime lender to make riskier loan to keep the pipeline of mortgage security well supply .
24433139	`` the market be pay I to do a no income verification loan more than it be pay I to do the full documentation loan , '' he say .
24433140	`` what would you do ? ''
